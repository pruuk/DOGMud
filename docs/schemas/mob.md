# Mob Schema Reference

## 1. Filename & Location

**Path formula:**
```
_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/{zone_folder}/{mobid}-{ConvertForFilename(name)}.yaml
```

- `{zone_folder}` = `ConvertForFilename(zone display name)` — lowercase, keep a-z/0-9, drop apostrophes, all other chars → underscore.
- `{ConvertForFilename(name)}` — same conversion applied to the mob's character name.

**Worked example:**
- Zone: `Sanctum Basin`, Mob ID: `12`, Name: `"Cave Troll"`
- Path: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/sanctum_basin/12-cave_troll.yaml`

**Optional JS script:**
```
_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/{zone_folder}/scripts/{mobid}-{ConvertForFilename(name)}-{scripttag}.js
```

**Existing zone folders:**
- `startland/`
- `sanctum_basin/`
- `endless_trashheap/`
- `test_arena/`
- `tutorial/`
- `test/`

**Workflow:** new mobs are usually built as part of a zone — see
`docs/guides/CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` Section 2 for the full zone-build
SOP including the `behavior_archetype` priority order.

## 2. Field Reference

### Top-level Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `mobid` | int | **yes** | Unique integer. Must match filename. |
| `zone` | string | **yes** | Display name of the zone (e.g. `"Sanctum Basin"`). |
| `hostile` | bool | no | Whether this mob attacks players on sight. Default: false. |
| `non_combatant` | bool | no | When true, mob cannot be attacked or stolen from — same gate that protects shopkeepers. Mob also won't aggro on player entry. Default: false. |
| `player_attack_immune` | bool | no | When true, mob rebuffs player-originated attacks (attack/bash/grapple/kick/shoot/taunt/throw/trip and steal) with a "you can't attack" message — like `non_combatant` — but still participates in mob-vs-mob combat. Used by caravan crew, who fight bandits but cannot be attacked by players. Default: false. |
| `charm_immune` | bool | no | Mob cannot be charmed (resists charm spells/effects). Default: false. |
| `pack_flee_immune` | bool | no | Mob does not flee when a packmate dies (overrides species-based pack flee). Default: false. |
| `maxwander` | int | no | Max rooms the mob will wander from its home room. 0 = stationary. |
| `activitylevel` | int | no | 1–100. How often the mob executes idle commands. Higher = more active. |
| `itemdropchance` | int | no | Percent chance (0–100) to drop carried items on death. |
| `statpool` | int | no | Stat points distributed across stats on spawn (weighted by archetype). |
| `archetype` | string | no | Stat distribution archetype: `"fighting"` (80% physical), `"casting"` (80% mental), or `""` (even). |
| `groups` | list | no | Group membership (e.g. `[rats, animal]`). Used for teamwork and hates logic, and drives corpse salvage returns (see `internal/crafting/corpse_salvage.go`). |
| `fold_anchor_room` | int | no | Room ID stamped into `MiscData["fold-anchor-room"]` at spawn. Lets the mob `cast fold-recall` to that room without first casting `fold-anchor`. Resolver: `internal/hooks/spell_foldrecall.go`. Used by hermit Old Edrin (Stage 3.0d), caravan crew (Stage 2), and the three Stage 3.1 foragers. |
| `hates` | list | no | Group names or species this mob will attack on sight. |
| `buffids` | list | no | Buff IDs always applied when mob spawns. |
| `questflags` | list | no | Quest flag strings set on this mob. |
| `scripttag` | string | no | Tag appended to the script filename. Must match the `.js` file. |
| `behavior_archetype` | string | no | Filename (without `.yaml`) of an archetype in `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/`. Drives the mob's behavior tree. **Strongly preferred over legacy `aiprofile`/`combatcommands`/`tactic_preset` for new mobs.** See "Behavior Archetypes" below. |
| `carry_capacity` | float | no | (Stage 3.4) Override Strength-derived carry capacity. Used by special mobs (wagons) where the default formula doesn't fit. Zero = use default calc. |
| `health_max` | int | no | (Stage 3.4) Override Vitality-derived max HP. Zero = use default calc. |
| `stamina_max` | int | no | (Stage 3.4) Override default max SP. Zero = use default calc. |
| `corpse_name` | string | no | (Stage 3.4) Override "<Name> corpse" rendering. Wagon uses "splintered wagon wreckage". Empty = use default. |
| `corpse_description` | string | no | (Stage 3.4) Override default corpse look-text via `description-corpse` template. Empty = use template. |
| `stock_multiplier` | float | no | (Stage 3.4) Shop stock-cap scale; default 1.0. EffectiveMaxStock = item.RarityTier × stock_multiplier. Future big-city shops can set > 1.0. |
| `aiprofile` | string | no | Legacy combat AI profile: `"default"`, `"aggressive"`, `"defensive"`, `"grappler"`, `"brawler"`, `"tactical"`. (legacy — prefer `behavior_archetype`) |
| `specialmovechance` | int | no | Base % chance to use special moves in combat (0–100). |
| `tactic_preset` | string | no | Reactive AI preset: `"aggressive_melee"`, `"defensive_caster"`, `"ambusher"`, `"tank"`. See Reactive AI below. (legacy — prefer `behavior_archetype`) |
| `tactics` | list | no | Custom tactic rules. Each entry: `trigger`, `action`, `priority`. Merged with preset. (legacy — prefer `behavior_archetype`) |
| `reaction_delay` | float | no | Seconds before reactive AI acts (0.25–4.0). Lower = faster reactions. (legacy — prefer `behavior_archetype`) |
| `tactical_discipline` | float | no | 0.0–1.0. Probability the mob follows through on a tactic. Higher = more reliable. (legacy — prefer `behavior_archetype`) |
| `idlecommands` | list | no | Commands executed while not in combat. Use `""` for empty (wait) turns. |
| `combatcommands` | list | no | Commands executed while in combat. |
| `spawnmutations` | list | no | Mutation IDs always granted at level 1 on spawn (Phase 24.3). |
| `mutationchance` | int | no | % chance (0–100) to gain 1 random bonus mutation on spawn (Phase 24.3). |
| `character` | object | **yes** | Character sub-object. See below. |
| `llmprofile` | object | no | LLM-driven dialogue. See below. |

### Character Sub-object

| `name` | string | **yes** | Mob's display name. Must match filename (`ConvertForFilename(name)`). |
| `description` | string | **yes** | Text shown when players look at the mob. |
| `speciesid` | int | **yes** | Species template. See known species below. |
| `level` | int | no | Starting level. Default: 1. |
| `gold` | int | no | Gold the mob carries (can be looted). |
| `stats` | map | no | Stat overrides. Each stat takes a `base` key (the mob's starting value for that stat). Never author `training`; see section 4a. |

## 3. Annotated Example

```yaml
# _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/startland/1-rat.yaml
mobid: 1                     # Must match filename (1-rat.yaml)
zone: Startland              # Display name; folder = startland/
itemdropchance: 10           # 10% chance to drop carried items on death

## 4. Gotchas

**Filename must match character.name exactly via `ConvertForFilename`.**
If mob name is `"Cave Troll"`, filename must be `{id}-cave_troll.yaml`. A mismatch causes either a startup panic or the mob loading silently under the wrong key.

**Zone folder must use underscores.**
`sanctum-basin/` will panic. Always `sanctum_basin/`.

**Script tag must match `.js` filename.**
If `scripttag: patrol`, the JS file must be named `{mobid}-{name}-patrol.js`. Mismatches cause the script to never load (no error, silent failure).

**LLMProfile is optional — dialogue file is the fallback.**
If Ollama is unreachable, the engine falls back to the mob's dialogue YAML (if one exists). Always provide at minimum a dialogue file for important NPCs. See `docs/schemas/dialogue.md`.

**Reactive AI fields require at least one tactic source.**
A mob needs either `tactic_preset` or `tactics` (or both) for the reactive AI to fire. Without either, the mob uses only the legacy `aiprofile` + `combatcommands` system. `reaction_delay` and `tactical_discipline` are only meaningful when tactics exist.

**Tactic presets:**
- `aggressive_melee` — kick prone targets, bash casters, submit grapplers
- `defensive_caster` — self-shield, AoE on multiple targets, flee when low, single-target spell
- `ambusher` — flee after engagement, hide when out of combat, trip casters
- `tank` — bash casters, kick prone targets, call for help when low

**Available triggers:** `combat_start`, `health_below:N`, `target_casting`, `target_prone`, `target_grappled`, `multiple_targets`, `single_target`, `no_aggro`, `not_hidden`, `after_action:X`, `player_entered`, `has_buff:N`, `missing_buff:N`

**Available actions:** `flee`, `hide`, `kick`, `bash`, `trip`, `call_for_help`, `retarget_strongest`, `cast <spell>`, `track_memory`, `recall`

**Authored stats go in `base:`, never `training:`.**
`StatInfo` has two authored-looking fields and they mean different things:

- `base:` is what the mob starts with. Leave a stat out entirely and it is
  filled in from the species record instead, so the mob tracks future species
  rebalances. Author `base:` only when this mob should differ from its species.
- `training:` is what progression has added *since the mob spawned*. A template
  has not spawned, so it is always zero there.

That distinction is load-bearing: U10b-0 makes the progression curve read
`Training` as its rank, so a template that parks its stat values there starts
partway down the decay curve and can be frozen by the gain cap at spawn.

Before 2026-08-22 the convention was the opposite and 599 templates authored
`training:`. `tools/fold_mob_training_to_base.py` folded them
(`base_new = species_base + training`) and
`TestNoMobTemplateCarriesAuthoredTraining` in `internal/mobs` now fails, naming
the file and line, if the old convention comes back. If you trip it, move the
number into `base:` and add the stat's species base to it.

One sharp edge: species hydration fills a stat whose `base:` key is **absent**,
not one whose base happens to be zero. `base: 0` therefore means a real zero and
is honoured (see `stats.StatInfo.BaseAuthored`). Two mobs rely on this.

**`statpool` distributes by archetype.**
Stats in `statpool` are weighted by `archetype` at spawn: `"fighting"` favors Str/Dex/Vit (80/20 split), `"casting"` favors Per/Wil/Cha (20/80 split), and default is uniform. Identical mob templates will still vary. Use explicit `stats:` overrides when a specific stat spread matters.

**`level` in `character:` sets baseline — statpool modifies it.**
The engine calls `AutoTrain()` after distributing statpool points. Do not set both a high level and a large statpool expecting them to stack cleanly.

## 5. Behavior Archetypes

`behavior_archetype` selects a behavior-tree YAML from
`_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/`. The archetype drives
combat decision-making, packmate awareness, and reactive AI without
needing to author per-mob `combatcommands`/`tactics`.

### Available archetypes

| Archetype | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `generic_fighter` | Melee with bash/trip/grapple toolkit. Default for non-tank fighters. |
| `tank_taunter` | Melee with signature taunt + self-buffs. For high-priority threats. |
| `melee_self_buff` | Melee fighter who pre-buffs before engaging. |
| `ambusher` | Hidden until engagement; high opening burst. |
| `pure_caster` | Spell-focused; flees from melee, kites with damage. |
| `support_caster` | Buffs/heals packmates; rarely the front-line target. |
| `leader` | Commands packmates, calls for help, coordinates. |
| `prey` | Flees on engagement; non-aggressive. |
| `lookout` | Stationary observer; calls for help when triggered. |
| `combat_passive` | In combat but doesn't attack — atmospheric or quest fodder. |
| `noncombat_passive` | Walks idles, no combat behavior. |
| `noncombat_questgiver` | Stationary, dialogue-only NPC. |
| `noncombat_shopkeeper` | Stationary shop NPC. |

### Priority for new mobs

When authoring a new mob:

1. **Reuse** an existing archetype if one fits.
2. **Author a new archetype YAML** under `behaviors/archetypes/` if
   the behavior pattern is reusable across multiple mobs.
3. **Custom legacy** (`aiprofile` + `combatcommands` + `tactic_preset`)
   ONLY for bosses or signature one-off NPCs.

See `docs/guides/CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` "Building a Full Zone" for the
full zone-build workflow including the smoke-test checklist.

### Pairing with stat distribution

`behavior_archetype` and `archetype` (stat distribution) usually pair
naturally:

- `pure_caster` / `support_caster` → `archetype: "casting"`
- `generic_fighter` / `tank_taunter` / `ambusher` /
  `melee_self_buff` → `archetype: "fighting"`
- `prey` / `noncombat_*` → `archetype: ""` (uniform)
