# Pinnacle item primitives (Stage 1 engine)

Stage 1 built the engine primitives that legendary-BIS "pinnacle" items
draw on: data-driven procs, pool reservations, a sentient bandolier,
mutation drip, weapon hunger, item voices, an assembly-recipe
provenance gate, and a remort potion. Stage 1 shipped **no player-
facing content** — no items reference these fields yet. This page is
the content-author reference for Stage 2/3/4: every field below is
implemented and verified against the actual code (not just the design
spec), on branch `feature/pinnacle-stage1-engine-primitives`.

All fields live on `ItemSpec` (`internal/items/itemspec.go`) unless
noted otherwise.

## 1. Procs (`procs:`)

```yaml
procs:
  - trigger: on_hit           # on_hit | on_kill | on_block | on_grapple | on_spell_hit
    chance: 25                # 1-100, percent per trigger event
    cooldown_rounds: 0        # 0 = no cooldown
    effect: lifesteal         # lifesteal | steal_pool | aoe_stun | apply_condition
    params:
      ratio: 0.25
```

`Validate()` rejects unknown `trigger`/`effect` values and requires
`chance` in 1-100 — bad data panics at boot, not at first swing.

**Which equipment slot is consulted, per trigger**
(`procBearingItems` in `internal/hooks/item_procs.go`):

| Trigger        | Slot consulted |
|----------------|----------------|
| `on_hit`       | Weapon |
| `on_kill`      | Weapon |
| `on_spell_hit` | Weapon |
| `on_block`     | Offhand |
| `on_grapple`   | Body |

Only one item per trigger is ever consulted (the cost discipline is
1-2 spec lookups per swing) — a proc authored on the wrong slot for
its trigger simply never fires.

**Gate order** (`procGateOpen`): `GamePlay.ItemProcsEnabled` kill
switch → per-(item, proc-index) cooldown check → chance roll. The
cooldown is marked **only when the effect actually executed** (e.g. a
`lifesteal` proc that rolls on a 0-damage hit does not burn its
cooldown) — see `dispatchItemProcs`'s `executed` flag.

**`on_kill` fires once per player with damage attribution on the
kill**, not just the killing blow (`MobDeathItemProcs` iterates
`evt.PlayerDamage`). This is a deliberate party-friendly design
decision, not an oversight — it also resets every such player's
Blackrazor-style hunger anchor (`pinnacle_last_kill_round`).

### Per-effect `params`

- **`lifesteal`** — `{ratio: <fraction>}`. Heals the attacker
  `ratio * damage` (floored, minimum 1 if ratio*damage rounds to 0),
  clamped to `HealthMax` by `Character.Heal`.
- **`steal_pool`** — `{pool: 3, amount_pct: <fraction>}`. Only
  `pool: 3` (conviction) is wired; `1` (health) and `2` (stamina) are
  reserved but **unimplemented** (YAGNI until an item needs them —
  they silently no-op). `amount_pct` is a fraction of the **target's**
  pool max, capped by what the target actually has; drains the target
  and adds to the owner (clamped to the owner's max).
- **`aoe_stun`** — `{}` (no params consumed; `stun_rounds` is
  intentionally ignored — see below). Applies condition **84** (a fixed
  1-round stagger/stun) to every hostile mob in the owner's room.
  Non-combatants, `PlayerAttackImmune` mobs, and **any** charmed mob
  (not just the owner's own charm) are always skipped — sparing
  bystanders' companions, matching the `HarmArea` precedent. Mob
  owners (no `GetUserId()`) are a no-op — no Stage-2 mob wields one of
  these. `stun_rounds` is ignored by design: condition 84 is a fixed
  1-round stagger baked into its own YAML (`triggercount: 1`) and
  cannot be duration-scaled from proc params without hacking condition
  internals; tune an aoe_stun item's strength via `chance`/
  `cooldown_rounds` instead.
- **`apply_condition`** — `{condition: 1, duration: <rounds>,
  magnitude: <per-tick>}`. Only `condition: 1` (bleeding) is wired.
  `duration` defaults to 4 rounds, `magnitude` defaults to 2 per tick,
  when unset or < 1. Unknown condition ids no-op (cooldown not
  burned).

## 2. Pool reservations

```yaml
reserve_health_pct: 0.10       # [0, 1) — validated, panics outside range
reserve_stamina_pct: 0.0
reserve_conviction_pct: 0.0
```

While the item is equipped, `Character.GetPoolReservation(pool,
poolMax)` (`internal/characters/validate.go`) sums the reservation
from **every** equipped item and clamps the character's **current**
pool value down to `max - totalReservation` (the max itself is
untouched — this is a squeeze, not a penalty to the ceiling). A
Chrysalis-enchanted item's own reservation and its `reserve_*_pct`
field **stack** — both are summed, by design, even on the same item.
Consumed in `validate.go`'s post-equip pass, `NewRound_AutoHeal.go`
(regen targets the reserved-down max, not the full max), the `report`
command, and the player prompt.

## 3. Bandolier (`is_bandolier:` items)

```yaml
is_bandolier: true
bandolier_capacity: 6
preserves_contents: true     # contents never age while stored
ambient_potions: true        # slotted potions' conditions stay always-on
```

- **`preserves_contents`** freezes aging: each round,
  `tickPreserveContents` advances every slotted potion's
  `CraftedRound` by 1 in lockstep with the round counter, so the
  aging-elapsed calculation (`now - CraftedRound`) never grows.
- **`ambient_potions`** keeps every slotted potion's `ConditionIds`
  continuously applied at **Peak potency (1.30x)**, `AddConditionScaled`,
  while the bandolier is worn and **attuned**. Drink-blocking of
  slotted potions is deferred to Stage 2 — Stage 1 does not stop you
  from drinking a slotted potion directly.
- **Attunement / content-fingerprint mechanism**: each tick builds a
  fingerprint of `beltItemId + sorted potion itemIds`
  (`bandolierFingerprint`). Any change — a slotted potion drunk,
  added, removed, or the belt itself swapped — flips the fingerprint,
  which immediately revokes all ambient conditions and stamps a cooldown
  running `Balance.BandolierAttuneRounds` (default 100) rounds into
  the future. Ambience only resumes once the fingerprint has been
  stable through that whole window. First-ever equip also counts as a
  fingerprint change (fp goes `"" → something`), so a freshly-equipped
  bandolier always pays the attunement cooldown once.

## 4. Mutation drip

```yaml
mutation_tick_interval: 50     # rounds between rolls; 0 = never
mutation_tick_chance: 10       # 1-100, required (validated) when interval > 0
mutation_rarity_floor: 5       # 0-10; minimum mutation rarity eligible, 0 = no floor
```

Every worn item (not slot-restricted like procs — the tick scans the
whole `GetAllWornItems()` set) with `mutation_tick_interval > 0` rolls
on interval-aligned rounds (`now % interval == 0`), then a percent
gate, then grants one mutation via
`Character.GrantRandomMutationRare(rarityFloor)`.

## 5. Hunger

```yaml
hunger_rounds: 100          # rounds without a kill before it starts feeding
hunger_drain_pct: 0.03      # [0, 1) fraction of HealthMax drained per hungry round
```

Gated on the **currently equipped weapon's** spec only
(`tickHunger` reads `c.Equipment.Weapon.GetSpec()`). The hunger clock
is **kill-anchored**: `pinnacle_hunger_anchor` starts at first tick
wielding the item, and any kill credit (`pinnacle_last_kill_round`,
stamped for every damage-attributed player on a kill, see §1) resets
it forward. Once overdue, drain escalates linearly from 1x up to a
hard cap of **3x** the base `hunger_drain_pct * HealthMax`, and
**never kills outright** — it floors the character at 1 HP. The drain
is applied directly to `Health`, **bypassing the damage hooks
entirely** (no sleep-wake, no aggro, no mitigation) — it's non-combat
attrition, not an attack. The feeding message is cooldown-gated
(reuses `Balance.SentientChatterCooldownRounds`) so an ignored hunger
debt doesn't spam a line every single overdue round. Swapping away
from a hunger weapon leaves its anchor stale but inert; re-wielding it
later re-bases the clock off the next kill/tick, with no separate
cleanup step.

## 6. Voices (`voice_id:`)

```yaml
voice_id: blackrazor
```

References `_datafiles/world/dogmud/itemvoices/<voiceid>.yaml`:

```yaml
voiceid: blackrazor
lines:
  on_equip: ["..."]
  on_unequip: ["..."]
  on_kill: ["..."]
  on_idle: ["..."]
  on_hunger_warning: ["..."]
  on_hunger_feeding: ["..."]
  on_taunt: ["..."]
  on_grudge: ["..."]
```

The `lines` map may use **exactly** these eight event keys
(`internal/itemvoices/itemvoices.go`'s `validVoiceEvents`) — any other
key panics at boot, and every key present must have a non-empty line
list. `itemvoices.LoadDataFiles()` also cross-validates every loaded
`ItemSpec.VoiceId` against the voice registry — a dangling `voice_id`
(referencing a voice file that doesn't exist) panics at boot, same as
`schedule_id`/`patrol_id`. `itemvoices.LoadDataFiles()` must run
**after** `items.LoadDataFiles()` for that cross-validation to see
every item. An empty `itemvoices/` directory is expected and correct
through the end of Stage 1 (`loadedCount=0` at boot is not an error).

**Pacing**: `pickVoiceEvent` picks `on_taunt` when the wearer is in
combat, `on_hunger_warning` when a hunger weapon has crossed 3/4 of its
hunger window, else `on_idle` — `on_equip`/`on_unequip`/`on_kill`/
`on_grudge` are authored slots for callers outside the tick (or future
wiring) to use via `emitVoiceLine` directly. Each eligible round rolls
once at `Balance.SentientChatterChancePct` (default 15) — only after
confirming a speakable line exists for the picked event, so quiet gear
never rolls. A successful line is paced by
`Balance.SentientChatterCooldownRounds` (default 20) between lines.
**Exactly one line per round, across all worn sentient items** — when
multiple voiced items are worn, the tick walks worn-slot order and the
first item with both a `voice_id` and a non-empty line pool for its
picked event wins the round; later sentient items never even roll
that round.

## 7. Recipes: `require_own_components`

```yaml
# on a RecipeSpec (internal/crafting)
require_own_components: true
```

When set, **every** ingredient that is itself a crafted component
(`ItemSpec.IsComponent == true`) must carry the assembling crafter's
`MakerName` — bulk (non-component) materials are exempt.
`CheckOwnComponents` is **strict-any-match**: if any tag-matching
component across the crafter's component bag + inventory is foreign,
the craft refuses, **even if the crafter also carries their own copy**
of that component — because `HasIngredients`/`ConsumeIngredients`
don't guarantee which matching item actually gets consumed, so the
engine can't safely assume the crafter's own copy would be the one
picked.

For this gate to be usable at all, component outputs must actually get
stamped: `ShouldStampMakerName` (skill 30+) now stamps `MakerName` on
a crafted output whenever `spec.Type != Object` **or**
`spec.IsComponent` — i.e., components stamp regardless of their
(conventionally `type: object`) declared Type.

## 8. Remort phial

Item id **40181** ("Phial of Second Birth") is **hardcoded** in
`internal/usercommands/drink.go` (`phialOfSecondBirthItemId`) — the
Stage 2 item YAML for this potion **must** use exactly this id, or the
special-case branch never fires. Drinking it:

1. `Character.ScourMutations(0)` — scours every acquired mutation back
   to species intrinsics, with **zero** reroll charges (contrast the
   unrelated Catalyst of Unmaking, which grants 3).
2. Immediately grants exactly one mutation via
   `GrantRandomMutationRare(5)` — rarity floor 5, hardcoded
   (`phialRarityFloor`).

## 9. Config knobs

| Knob | Location | Default | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| `GamePlay.PinnacleItemsEnabled` | config.gameplay.go | `true` | Master toggle for the whole per-round pinnacle tick (hunger/ambient/mutation-drip/voices); `pinnacleUserTick` early-returns entirely when off. |
| `GamePlay.ItemProcsEnabled` | config.gameplay.go | `true` | Kill switch for proc firing (`on_hit`/`on_block`/etc.); checked in `procGateOpen`. |
| `Balance.BandolierAttuneRounds` | config.balance.go | `100` | Re-attunement cooldown length after bandolier contents change. |
| `Balance.SentientChatterCooldownRounds` | config.balance.go | `20` | Minimum rounds between sentient item lines (also reused to pace the hunger-feeding message). |
| `Balance.SentientChatterChancePct` | config.balance.go | `15` | Percent chance per eligible round that a sentient item speaks. |

## 10. MiscData key registry (admin/debugging)

All keys live on the `Character`'s MiscData map and persist to player
YAML (numeric values round-trip through YAML as `int`/`int64`/
`float64` — readers tolerate all three).

| Key | Set by | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `pinnacle_proc_cd_<itemId>_<procIdx>` | `markProcCooldown` | Round at which this item's Nth proc may fire again. |
| `pinnacle_last_kill_round` | `MobDeathItemProcs` | Last round this player got damage-attribution credit on a kill (drives hunger reset). |
| `pinnacle_hunger_anchor` | `tickHunger` | Round the current hunger weapon's clock is anchored to. |
| `pinnacle_hunger_msg_next_round` | `tickHunger` | Cooldown gate for the repeated feeding message. |
| `pinnacle_bandolier_attune_round` | `tickAmbientPotions` | Round at which ambient conditions may resume after a content change. |
| `pinnacle_bandolier_conditions` | `tickAmbientPotions` | The set of condition ids currently applied as ambience (so removal/rotation can be revoked cleanly). |
| `pinnacle_bandolier_fingerprint` | `tickAmbientPotions` | Last-seen `beltId:potionId,potionId,...` fingerprint, used to detect any content change. |
| `pinnacle_voice_next_round` | `tickVoices` | Cooldown gate between sentient item lines. |

Cooldown keys (`pinnacle_proc_cd_*` in particular) are **intentionally
never pruned** when an item is unequipped or lost — the key space is
bounded (per item id x proc index) and a stale cooldown is harmless
(it just means that exact item, if re-equipped, resumes mid-cooldown
rather than fresh). This is a deliberate simplicity trade-off, not an
oversight.

## Stage 2 shipped items

The nine legendary-BIS items that consume the Stage 1 primitives,
shipped on branch `feature/pinnacle-stage2-items`. All boot-verified
(`itemLoadedCount=386`, `itemvoices loadedCount=2`, condition 98 present,
`ValidateZoneConsistency errors=0 mode=panic`, 0 panics). Numbers are
starting values; combat/economy tuning is a later stage.

> **Folder gotcha — do NOT create a `pinnacle/` directory.**
> `ItemSpec.ItemFolder()` (`internal/items/itemspec.go`) buckets items
> **purely by ID range**: any `ItemId >= 40000` is loaded flat from
> `_datafiles/world/dogmud/items/materials-40000/` — no subtype
> subdirectory (unlike `armor-20000/<type>/`). Because these nine were
> allocated in the 40000 block, they live alongside crafting materials
> regardless of being weapons/armor/accessories. A file placed in any
> other directory (e.g. a hand-made `pinnacle-items/`) is never loaded.

## Stage 3 reagents

Eighteen legendary-tier crafting reagents (ids **40190-40207**, all in
`items/materials-40000/`, all `is_component: true`, `rarity_tier: 82`)
that feed the Stage 4 pinnacle recipes. They arrive by three routes:
rare drops off endgame bosses, zone-exclusive player-forage, and one
storm-gated forage. Every reagent carries a stable `component_tag` —
Stage 4 recipe authors reference **these exact tags** (never item ids)
in `ingredients:`. Boot-verified `itemLoadedCount=404` (386 Stage-2 +
18), `mobs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=610`, `ValidateZoneConsistency
errors=0 warnings=0 mode=panic`, 0 panics.

> **Note — the existing 40166 Pale-Grey Casting** (`component_tag:
> grey-relic`, `rarity_tier: 85`) is the pre-Stage-3 pinnacle reagent:
> it drops off **the Sentinel** (Eastern Highlands boss) and is the
> gate material for **The Blackrazor** (40183). It is not part of the
> Stage 3 block but shares the same recipe-reagent role, so Stage 4
> authors should treat it alongside the tags below.

### Reagent → component_tag → source

| 40199 | Mockingbird Amber | `mockingbird-amber` | forage: Ironwind Steppe |
| 40200 | Ironwood Thorn-Heart | `ironwood-thorn-heart` | forage: The Fernway South |

| 40206 | Gale-Sinew of the Steppe | `gale-sinew-steppe` | drop: Windscour Wyrm (229, Ironwind Steppe), 5% |
| 40207 | Folded-Space Silk | `folded-space-silk` | drop: The Foldweaver (9583, apex 5%) + Fold Broodling (9581, 1%), The Foldweave |

### Forage overlay (`internal/forager/forage_core.go`)

The forage reagents are **player-forage only** — they are *not* added
to NPC-forager yield pools. Two overlay tables, both consulted in
`forageYieldPool`, appended onto the biome-common pool (a single rare
entry among many commons = the rarest outcome):

- **`ZoneForageYields`** — keyed by **zone display name**. Appended
  only when the player forages in that exact zone. Carries the five
  zone-exclusive reagents: `Stillwater Marsh` → 40198 + 40202,
  `Ironwind Steppe` → 40199, `The Fernway South` → 40200, `Labyrinth
  of Low Tunnels` → 40201, `The Confluence` → 40203.
- **`StormForageYields`** — keyed by **biome**, appended only when the
  zone's current weather is `"storm"`. Carries `mountains` → 40204
  (Stormfront Residue, highland storms only).

The `ForageRequest`'s `Zone` and `Weather` fields are set on the
player-forage path only; the NPC-forager path leaves them empty, so
neither overlay ever fires for NPCs.

### The Foldweave zone

A new `non_cartesian: true` cave zone (**The Foldweave**, rooms
**6426-6437**, zone-config `roomid: 6426`, biome `cave`) hung off a
**secret `down` exit** from The Fernway South room **4161** (a hidden
root-gap under the great pine; the up-return from 6426 lands back at
4161). Twelve rooms of space-folding spider-warren — the fiction is
purely spider-craft (a spider that folds the space it spins), read
clean by the world-critic for lore-boundary discipline. Four spiders
on species 17: Web Skitterer (9580), Fold Broodling (9581), Silk
Lurker (9582), and the apex **Foldweaver (9583)**, which drops the
zone-signature reagent **40207 Folded-Space Silk** (also a rare 1%
trickle off broodlings). Being `non_cartesian`, the zone is exempt
from the hard cartesian consistency checks (renders wrap exits as edge
stubs); it boots with `errors=0 warnings=0`.

## Stage 4a: recipes + workshop

The crafting backbone that turns the Stage-2 items + Stage-3 reagents
into a two-tier craft chain, all authored on branch
`feature/pinnacle-stage4a-crafting-backbone`. Boot-verified
`itemLoadedCount=421` (404 + 17 components), `crafting.LoadRecipeFiles
loadedCount=126` (100 base + 17 component + 9 assembly),
`mobs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=611`, Veyra's schedule validates,
zero `ValidateRecipeIngredientTags` faults, `ValidateZoneConsistency
errors=0 mode=panic`, 0 panics.

**The two tiers.** A player first crafts the **component** (an
everyday, discoverable recipe, `skill_minimum: 50`, no gating) at an
ordinary station, then hands those self-made components — plus the
rare Stage-3 reagents and bulk stock — to a **quest-taught assembly
recipe** (`skill_minimum: 65`, `learn_only: true`,
`require_own_components: true`) to produce the legendary-BIS item.
Stage 4b's secret-recipe quests are what teach the assembly slugs via
`learn_recipe`.

### The 9 assembly recipes (Stage 4b teaches these slugs)

Each `learn_only: true` + `require_own_components: true`,
`skill_minimum: 65`, `time_rounds: 20`. Files live in
`_datafiles/world/dogmud/recipes/<skill>/<slug>.yaml`.

| Assembly slug | Output id | Item | Skill | Station |
|---------------|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| `assemble-the-blackrazor` | 40183 | The Blackrazor | blacksmithing | forge |
| `assemble-aegis-of-mockery` | 40185 | Aegis of Mockery | blacksmithing | forge |
| `assemble-thornwall-harness` | 40186 | Thornwall Harness | tailoring | loom |
| `assemble-wayfarers-pack` | 40184 | Wayfarer's Bottomless Pack | tailoring | loom |
| `assemble-zephyr-treads` | 40188 | Zephyr Treads | tailoring | loom |
| `assemble-phial-of-second-birth` | 40181 | Phial of Second Birth | alchemy | alchemy_bench |
| `assemble-vitalis-bandolier` | 40182 | Vitalis Bandolier | alchemy | alchemy_bench |
| `assemble-seething-prism` | 40187 | Seething Prism | jewelcrafting | jeweler_bench |
| `assemble-hollow-choir-staff` | 40189 | Staff of the Hollow Choir | enchanting | enchanting_circle |

### The 17 components → recipe(skill) → assembly

Each component is a self-crafted subcomponent (ids **40208-40224**,
`is_component: true`, `rarity_tier: 78`), made by a discoverable
`skill_minimum: 50` recipe of the same slug. `require_own_components`
checks each component's `MakerName` — the player must craft these
themselves before the assembly will accept them. The bulk materials
and Stage-3 reagents each assembly also consumes are NOT self-craft-
gated (only `is_component` items are). Note the assemblies each take
**two** of these components except `assemble-phial-of-second-birth`,
which takes only `reduction-base`.

| Component id | component_tag (= recipe slug) | Recipe skill | Station | Feeds assembly |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| 40208 | `reinforced-harness` | tailoring | loom | `assemble-vitalis-bandolier` |
| 40209 | `preservation-runes` | enchanting | enchanting_circle | `assemble-vitalis-bandolier` |
| 40210 | `hungering-guard` | jewelcrafting | jeweler_bench | `assemble-the-blackrazor` |
| 40211 | `obsidian-edge-resin` | alchemy | alchemy_bench | `assemble-the-blackrazor` |

### Veyra's workshop (The Confluence, craft row)

All six craft stations the chain needs sit within one small
workshop-plus-annexes hung off the Confluence craft row, so the whole
backbone is reachable from one place. Veyra Coil-Tongue (mob **9584**,
`crafter: true`, `non_combatant`, `schedule_id: veyra`) is the
convergence-crafter who anchors it: Stage 4b's secret-recipe sales run
through her.

| Room | Title | Station |
|------|-------|---------|
| 6438 | Veyra's Workshop | `alchemy_bench` (Veyra spawns here) |
| 6439 | The Gem-Bench Nook | `jeweler_bench` |
| 6440 | The Warded Corner | `enchanting_circle` |
| 6441 | The Reduction Hearth | `cooking_fire` |
| 6235 | (existing craft-row room) | `loom` (station added Stage 4a) |
| 6239 | (existing craft-row room) | `forge` (station added Stage 4a) |

Access: room **6233** (craft row) gained an `up` exit to the workshop
(6438); the four annex rooms connect off 6438 (north/east/west), which
also has `down` back to 6233. Veyra's schedule (`schedules/
the_confluence/veyra.yaml`) keeps her at the alchemy bench crafting
06:00-22:00 and sleeping there 22:00-06:00.

### Author notes

- **`learn_only` (assembly recipes).** The nine assembly recipes are
  excluded from craft-discovery (`GetEligibleRecipes` skips
  `LearnOnly`), so a player can never stumble onto them at the bench.
  They are taught only by quest `learn_recipe` (bought from Veyra)
  or admin `learn`. Help templates exist for every recipe (`help
  <slug>`) as reference — the help file is documentation, not the
  gate.
- **`require_own_components` (assembly recipes).** Every `is_component`
  ingredient must carry the assembling crafter's `MakerName`; the
  gate is strict-any-match (see §7). This is why the components are
  ordinary self-craftable recipes: the design intent is that the
  player who assembles a masterwork forged its subcomponents with
  their own hands. Bulk stock and Stage-3 reagents are exempt.
- The 17 component recipes have no `require_own_components`. As
  authored they were plain discoverable recipes; since 2026-10-05 they
  are `learn_only`, taught by buying the secret they belong to (each
  one's output feeds only its own assembly, pinned by
  `TestPinnacleSubRecipes_LearnOnly`).

## Stage 4b: Veyra's secret recipes

Veyra sells the nine `learn_only` assembly recipes from Stage 4a, and
buying a secret also teaches the sub-recipes it needs. Without the
purchase those slugs are unreachable by any player.

### Quests

Quest **78 "The Convergence"** is the masterwork-gated introduction: it
fires the instant `78-start` is granted and grants `78-end` in the same
beat. There is no separate player step; the quest only gives Veyra's
dialogue a `questRequired` token ("known to Veyra") to key on. Quests
**79-87** are the nine secrets, one per pinnacle item, named "Secret of
the ..." after the item. They charge nothing themselves: the gold is
taken by the dialogue node that grants `{id}-start`, and the quest's
`quest_granted` trigger then teaches the recipes.

| Quest | Slug | Item (id) | Skill | Price |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| 79 | bandolier | Vitalis Bandolier (40182) | alchemy | 17,500 |
| 80 | blackrazor | The Blackrazor (40183) | blacksmithing | 25,000 |
| 81 | wayfarer | Wayfarer's Bottomless Pack (40184) | tailoring | 12,500 |
| 82 | aegis | Aegis of Mockery (40185) | blacksmithing | 20,000 |
| 83 | thornwall | Thornwall Harness (40186) | tailoring | 15,000 |
| 84 | prism | Seething Prism (40187) | jewelcrafting | 20,000 |
| 85 | zephyr | Zephyr Treads (40188) | tailoring | 12,500 |
| 86 | choir | Staff of the Hollow Choir (40189) | enchanting | 22,500 |
| 87 | phial | Phial of Second Birth (40181) | alchemy | 15,000 |

Each secret has one price, paid in full when Veyra shares it. A player
may buy any number of the nine, each once. All nine assembly recipes
and the 17 sub-recipes are `learn_only`, so the purchase is the only
way to learn the chain.

### Buying a secret

1. Player carries a self-crafted skill-50+ item (the masterwork gate,
   `HasOwnMasterwork`) and asks Veyra about the convergence. Her
   `convergence_intro` dialogue node grants `78-start`.
2. Quest 78's `quest_granted` trigger grants `78-end` in the same beat;
   the player is now "known" to Veyra.
3. Each secret has four dialogue nodes, in this order:
   - `owned_`: the player already holds `{id}-start`; she says she does
     not sell a secret twice. It keys on the quest token, never on
     recipe knowledge, so a player who found sub-recipes at the bench
     can still buy the secret.
   - `teach_`: the purchase, on "teach <name>". It carries
     `goldRequired` and `chargesGold` at the price, so the engine
     checks and takes the gold in one step, before it grants
     `{id}-start`. It is excluded once `{id}-start` or `{id}-end` is
     held.
   - `refuse_`: the same teach phrases when the player lacks the gold.
     It names the price and grants nothing.
   - `price_`: the bare name. It states the price and the command to
     buy, and never buys.
4. The granted quest's `quest_granted` trigger teaches the two component
   recipes plus the one assembly recipe (`learn_recipe` x3, x1 for the
   phial which only needs `reduction-base`), and has Veyra narrate the
   hand-off. It charges nothing.
5. Player gathers the Stage-3 reagents, crafts the components
   themselves (so `require_own_components` accepts them), and
   assembles the pinnacle item at one of Veyra's stations.
6. The crafted item's `item_gain` trigger (gated on `has: {id}-start`,
   `missing: {id}-end`) grants `{id}-end` and has Veyra comment on the
   finished piece.

`GameBridge.ChargeGold` refuses, taking nothing and failing the action,
when the player holds less than the amount. The Phial (87) is sold once
like the other eight; there is no repeat purchase.

### Veyra's dialogue gating (`dialogue/the_confluence/9584.yaml`)

Root variants partition every player into one state: unknown without a
masterwork (flavor-only), unknown with a masterwork (the intro-grant
variant), and known (the greeting that names all nine secrets, with a
truth-knower variant for players who've finished `77-end`). Asking
about a secret by name never buys it. The known greeting, the
`secrets_list` node and a known-player fallback pattern name all nine
secrets without prices, so the item names stay discoverable. The
name triggers on the `owned_`, `teach_`, `refuse_` and `price_` nodes
are distinctive words only (`bandolier`, `blackrazor`, `zephyr`, etc.),
and the generic `quest`/`task` triggers appear only on the intro and
`secrets_list` nodes, which grant nothing beyond `78-start`.
`quest_charge_gold_gate_guard_test.go` and
`veyra_secrets_dialogue_test.go` pin the purchase.

### Engine additions (Stage 4b)

1. **`charge_gold` action + `has_gold` condition**
   (`internal/questengine/types.go`) — stages a gold fee on a quest
   trigger or gates one on a minimum balance. Since 2026-10-05 a charge
   the player cannot cover is refused (nothing taken, trigger abandoned).
2. **Masterwork entry gate** — `Character.HasOwnMasterwork(skillMin)`
   (`internal/characters/masterwork.go`) reports whether the player
   carries any item with `MakerName == their own Name` and
   `CraftSkill >= skillMin`. Exposed as a dialogue `masterworkRequired`
   gate and a quest `has_masterwork` condition.
3. **Quest-grant bridge** (`internal/hooks/Quest_HandleQuestUpdate.go`)
   — a quest token granted by dialogue's `grantsQuest` (or any other
   legacy path) now also fires the questengine's `quest_granted`
   triggers, notifying only on a fresh grant so questengine-initiated
   grants don't double-fire. Before this fix, dialogue-granted tokens
   could not start a questengine quest at all, so the entire secret-recipe
   design (Veyra's dialogue grants `{id}-start`, the questengine quest
   reacts to it) depends on this bridge.
4. **`require_own_components` scope fix**
   (`internal/crafting/crafting.go`) — the own-work gate now applies
   only to ingredient tags that are some recipe's own output (a
   genuinely crafted sub-assembly), exempting drop/forage reagents
   that are `is_component` purely for bag-routing but can never carry
   a maker's mark.

### Note

The Phial of Second Birth (87) is sold once, same as the other eight
secrets; the questengine quest format has no `repeatable` field. Making
it repeatable (so a player could re-roll a mutation more than once) is a
deferred enhancement.
