# Material Region Audit Matrix

> **Purpose:** Durable classification of all caravan-relevant raw
> materials into regional supply buckets. Consumed by Stages 3.0c
> (south expansion zone build), 3.1 (forager NPCs), 3.0e (corpse
> salvage), and 3.4 (real item transfer).
>
> Classification per spec
> `docs/superpowers/specs/completed/2026-04-28-mat-region-split-design.md`.
>
> **Implementation note:** This matrix is mirrored in
> `internal/economy/buckets.go`. Drift between the two is caught at
> test time by `TestBucketMap_AuditMatrixCoverage`.

## Bucket definitions

- **Stillwater** — Lake/marsh/fishing themed; native at Stillwater
  foragers and local vendors
- **Thornwall** — Chrysalis/refined-metal/jewelcraft themed; in-shop
  crafted at Thornwall workshops
- **Fernway** — Forest/herbal/wild-game themed; foraged in The
  Fernway, distributed by caravan to both towns
- **Confluence** — River/water-forage themed; native at The
  Confluence river-trade vendors, distributed by ferry trade factor
  (Stage 2)
- **Base** — Universal crafting feedstock with no regional flavor;
  available everywhere
- **Mid-tier overlap** — Mats that fit two of three regions; available
  at vendors of either region
- **Defer to 3.0e** — Cloth/leather/cord/sinew mats; classification
  done now, vendor wiring deferred until corpse salvage lands
- **Quest/specialty** — Quest items or non-crafting props; not part of
  the supply pipeline

## Rarity tiers (Stage 3.4)

Each classified mat carries a `rarity_tier` (50/40/30/20/10) on its
ItemSpec YAML, replacing per-vendor `max_stock` entries. EffectiveMaxStock
= rarity_tier × shopkeeper.stock_multiplier (default 1.0).

| Tier | Cap | Mats | Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| **50 — Common** | 50 | All Base bucket (13) + copper wire (40021) + binding paste (40028) | 15 |
| **40 — Standard** | 40 | All Mid-tier overlap (11) + Hive Fragment (40011), steel ingot (40018), silver wire (40022), polished stone (40024), gem dust (40026), chrysalis setting (40030) | 17 |
| **30 — Regional** | 30 | Stillwater non-pearl (5) + all Fernway (8) + raw gem (40025) | 14 |
| **20 — Uncommon** | 20 | Stillwater black pearl (40053), Chrysalis Core (40010), chrysalis shard (40027), mutation catalyst (40029), gold wire (40023) | 5 |
| **10 — Ultra-rare** | 10 | RESERVED — no current items | 0 |

Quest items and defer-to-3.0e items (40031–40042, 40052, 40054, 40055,
40060, 40061) intentionally have no rarity_tier — EffectiveMaxStock
returns 0, loader falls back to legacy hardcoded values.

## Vendor pair pattern

Each Stillwater vendor has a same-craft Thornwall counterpart. Both
stock identical mat slot lists (filled by different supply pipelines).
See spec for the full pair table.

## Caravan flow (post-3.1/3.4)

- **Northbound (Thornwall to Stillwater):** Thornwall-unique
  chrysalis/refined-metal mats
- **Southbound (Stillwater to Thornwall):** Stillwater-unique
  lake/marsh mats
- **Fernway to both towns:** Fernway-unique forest mats picked up by
  caravan in The Fernway zone

Foragers + the 3.4 real item transfer fill these flows; until those
land, vendor seed stock is the only supply.

## Judgment calls & re-audit flags

- **40008 spore sac** — Marked Mid-tier overlap (Fernway + Labyrinth)
  but is NOT is_component (subtype: holdable). If a recipe is added
  that consumes it, update component_tag and is_component then
  re-confirm bucket.
- **40012 thread spool / 40013 bone needle** — Retained as Base rather
  than Defer to 3.0e. Both are is_component: true and used in current
  tailoring/leatherwork recipes as generic feedstock, not
  cloth/leather drops. If they become salvage outputs in 3.0e,
  re-evaluate.
- **40019 chain link** — Listed as Base (universal smithing feedstock)
  despite being used in jewelcraft. Keep Base; it crosses both
  smithing and jewelcraft and has no regional flavor.
- **40020 coal dust** — Mid-tier overlap (Thornwall-leaning). Could be
  Base; kept as overlap because it has no recipe demand outside
  smithing and Thornwall is the smithing hub. Re-evaluate if
  Stillwater gets a forge.
- **40038 oil lantern / 40039 freight crate / 40040 forest herbs** —
  All marked Quest/specialty. None have is_component: true. They are
  props or holdable bundles used in NPC/caravan quest scripting.
  If any gain crafting recipe demand in future stages, update
  is_component and re-classify bucket.
- **40044 sealed phial / 40045 crystalline decanter** — Description
  references chrysalis-infused seals (Thornwall flavor), but kept as
  Base because they are alchemy infrastructure items sold universally.
  If a Thornwall weaver monopoly is desired, reclassify to Thornwall.
- **40046 moonpetal** — Classified Fernway (forest meadow nocturnal
  flower). No explicit "forest" language in description but nocturnal
  wildflower fits Fernway forage far better than steppe or lake.
  Flag if intended as Thornwall greenhouse stock instead.
- **40047 veilbloom petal** — Description explicitly states
  "wind-scoured steppes" — classified Mid-tier overlap
  (Dustwalk + Thornwall), NOT Fernway. If the south expansion zone
  includes steppes, re-evaluate.
- **40050 putrid residue** — Mid-tier overlap (Labyrinth + Thornwall
  alchemy). Value is 1g; clearly a low-tier junk drop. Could also
  fit Base. Kept as overlap because its only use is volatile alchemy
  (Thornwall demand) and dungeon fringe sourcing.
