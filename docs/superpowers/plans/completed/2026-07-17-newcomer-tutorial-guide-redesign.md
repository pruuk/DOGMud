# Newcomer Tutorial Guide Redesign — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Rebuild the route-1 "complete noob" antechamber (rooms 6258–6262 + one new room) into a strict, guide-led tutorial: a named mentor (Dewey) walks the player through look/examine/move, status + progression, get/inventory/help, say/ask, a combat primer teaching conditions + the shared cooldown + all three playstyles, and flee — then hands off to the Awakening Pool.

**Architecture:** Almost entirely **data** (room YAML + room behavior-tree YAML + mob YAML + dialogue YAML). The engine loads these; per-instance `set_state` flags gate each lesson. One small **Go** addition: a `grant_progression` behavior action so the player sees a real progression banner once. No changes to `start.go`, quests 21/30/31, Cleric Hadwen, or Pothole Coulee.

**Tech Stack:** Go (behavior-tree action), YAML data files (rooms, room behavior trees, mobs, dialogue, goals), the GoMud room-behavior-tree runtime (`internal/behaviortree`).

**Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/completed/2026-07-17-newcomer-tutorial-guide-redesign-design.md`

---

## Shared conventions (read once, apply in every task)

**Command highlighting.** Every command word Dewey speaks is wrapped
`<ansi fg="command">look</ansi>` (color alias `command`, cyan). Never use the old
plain-double-space style.

**Dewey speaks via `mob_say`.** In room behavior trees, Dewey's lines are authored
as `do: mob_say`, `mob_id: 9491`, `text: ...`. The engine renders them as
`Dewey says, "..."`. Dewey (mob 9491) must be in every antechamber room's
`spawninfo`.

**Gating idiom.** Each room tree is a `selector` of `sequence` children, each child
`event: room_command`. Lesson branches come first (specific → general), then a
movement/exit-block branch last. Lesson branches set a per-instance flag with
`set_state` and generally do **not** `intercept` (so the taught command still runs
normally). The block branch fires only while the gate flag is unset and always
`intercept`s. Per-instance state is keyed by the ephemeral instance room, so each
player's copy gates independently.

**Room IDs (forward order):** 6258 → 6259 → 6260 → 6261 → 6262 → **6467** (new;
6263 is taken by `east_road_to_greenford`). Each room (including room 5, 6262) has
exactly **one forward exit, `north`, to the next room**. This matters: the
antechamber runs as a private **ephemeral instance**, and the instance runtime
remaps real exits to each player's private copy. In-instance hops must therefore
use the real `north` exit — **never** `move_player(templateId)` between two
in-instance rooms (that would pull the player into the shared template room). Only
the final hop from room 6 (6467) to room 5200 (a real, non-instanced Pothole Coulee
room) uses `move_player`, exactly as the old terminus did. Because room 5's only
exit is `north`, `flee` there can only carry the player forward. Mob IDs: Dewey =
9491 (re-themed), effigy = **9614** (new).

**Zone folder:** `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/newcomer_antechamber/`,
`.../behaviors/rooms/newcomer_antechamber/`, `.../mobs/newcomer_antechamber/`,
`.../dialogue/newcomer_antechamber/`, `.../goals/`.

**Before any smoke test, wipe instance saves** (SOP):
```bash
rm -rf _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs.instances/* _datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms.instances/*
```

## Task 1: `grant_progression` behavior action (Go, TDD)

Adds a room-usable action that forces exactly one real skill-progression event
(with the standard banner) for the triggering player. Mirrors the guardrail-test
style already used by `actions_move_player_test.go` in this package (happy path is
covered by the live walk-through in Task 11).

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/behaviortree/actions_progression.go`
- Modify: `internal/behaviortree/actions.go` (register the action, ~line 63 block)
- Test: `internal/behaviortree/actions_progression_test.go`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `internal/behaviortree/actions_progression_test.go`:

```go
package behaviortree

import "testing"

// grant_progression forces one real skill-progression event for the triggering
// player (used by the newcomer tutorial to show the banner once). These pin the
// guardrails; the happy path (real user, skill actually increments + banner) is
// covered by the live tutorial walk-through, matching actions_move_player_test.go.

func TestGrantProgression_RegisteredInActionRegistry(t *testing.T) {
	if _, ok := actionRegistry["grant_progression"]; !ok {
		t.Fatal("grant_progression not registered in actionRegistry")
	}
}

func TestGrantProgression_NoTriggeringPlayer_Failure(t *testing.T) {
	ctx := &EvalContext{Event: EventContext{EventType: "room_command", UserId: 0}}
	if res := actGrantProgression(map[string]any{"skill": "spellcasting"}, ctx); res != Failure {
		t.Errorf("expected Failure with no triggering player, got %v", res)
	}
}

func TestGrantProgression_MissingSkillParam_Failure(t *testing.T) {
	// UserId 42 is not registered; but the missing-skill guard should fire first.
	ctx := &EvalContext{Event: EventContext{EventType: "room_command", UserId: 42}}
	if res := actGrantProgression(map[string]any{}, ctx); res != Failure {
		t.Errorf("expected Failure with no skill param, got %v", res)
	}
}

func TestGrantProgression_UnknownUser_Failure(t *testing.T) {
	ctx := &EvalContext{Event: EventContext{EventType: "room_command", UserId: 42}}
	if res := actGrantProgression(map[string]any{"skill": "spellcasting"}, ctx); res != Failure {
		t.Errorf("expected Failure for unknown user, got %v", res)
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test to verify it fails**

Run: `go test ./internal/behaviortree/ -run TestGrantProgression -v`
Expected: FAIL — `undefined: actGrantProgression` (compile error).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `internal/behaviortree/actions_progression.go`:

```go
package behaviortree

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// actGrantProgression forces exactly one real skill-progression event for the
// triggering player, emitting the standard SKILL ADVANCEMENT banner. It calls the
// genuine CheckSkillProgression with a large bonus multiplier: the chance clamps
// to 1.0 (progression.go), so the roll is guaranteed, and the real path does the
// IncreaseSkill + tier bookkeeping and queues the banner. The tutorial guards this
// to fire once via a room set_state flag.
//
// params: skill (string) — the skill tag to advance (e.g. "spellcasting").
func actGrantProgression(params map[string]any, ctx *EvalContext) Result {
	user := users.GetByUserId(ctx.Event.UserId)
	if user == nil {
		return Failure
	}
	skill := getStringParam(params, "skill")
	if skill == "" {
		return Failure
	}
	user.Character.CheckSkillProgression(skill, user.UserId, 1000.0)
	return Success
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Register the action**

In `internal/behaviortree/actions.go`, in the "New actions for room behavior trees"
block (near line 63, alongside `send_user_text`/`mob_say`), add:

```go
	actionRegistry["grant_progression"] = actGrantProgression
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test to verify it passes**

Run: `go test ./internal/behaviortree/ -run TestGrantProgression -v`
Expected: PASS (all four tests).

- [ ] **Step 6: Build the whole engine**

Run: `go build ./...`
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/behaviortree/actions_progression.go internal/behaviortree/actions.go internal/behaviortree/actions_progression_test.go
git commit -m "feat(behaviortree): grant_progression room action for tutorial banner"
```

---

## Task 2: Config — add room 6467 to TutorialRooms + fix stale comment

**Files:**
- Modify: `_datafiles/config.yaml` (SpecialRooms block, ~line 1297-1303)

- [ ] **Step 1: Edit the TutorialRooms array and comment**

Replace:
```yaml
  #   Sanctum Basin replaces the old tutorial zone; TutorialRooms is intentionally empty.
  TutorialRooms: ["6258", "6259", "6260", "6261", "6262"]
```
with:
```yaml
  #   The Newcomer Antechamber (rooms 6258-6262 + 6467) is the route-1 guided
  #   tutorial. The first id is where a new "complete noob" player is placed.
  TutorialRooms: ["6258", "6259", "6260", "6261", "6262", "6467"]
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify YAML parses**

Run: `python -c "import yaml,sys; yaml.safe_load(open('_datafiles/config.yaml'))" && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/config.yaml
git commit -m "chore(config): add tutorial room 6467 to TutorialRooms; fix stale comment"
```

## Task 3: Re-theme the guide mob into Dewey

The existing guide (mob 9491) becomes **Dewey**, a warm named mentor. The mob file
must be renamed to match the new name (`ConvertForFilename("Dewey")` → `dewey`), or
the loader panics at startup. The goals file is renamed alongside it.

**Files:**
- Delete: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9491-the_guide.yaml`
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9491-dewey.yaml`
- Rename: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9491-the_guide.yaml` → `.../goals/9491-dewey.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the new Dewey mob file**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9491-dewey.yaml`:
```yaml
mobid: 9491
zone: Newcomer Antechamber
behavior_archetype: noncombat_passive
non_combatant: true
charm_immune: true
hostile: false
statpool: 30
maxwander: 0
groups:
  - humanoid
character:
  name: Dewey
  description: |
    A wiry figure with laugh-lines and patient eyes, dressed in plain,
    travel-worn clothes. Unlike everything else in this grey place, Dewey
    is solid and warm -- a person, not a trick of the light. Dewey came
    through here once, frightened and brand-new, and never quite left the
    threshold: someone has to catch the next ones as they wake.
  speciesid: 1
  level: 1
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete the old guide mob file**

```bash
git rm _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9491-the_guide.yaml
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Rename the goals file**

```bash
git mv _datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9491-the_guide.yaml _datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9491-dewey.yaml
```
(Content stays: `mob_id: 9491`, `next_goal_id: 1`, `seeded_from_archetype: true`,
`goals: []` — no edit needed; the file is keyed by `mob_id` internally.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit** (boot verification happens in Task 11)

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9491-dewey.yaml
git commit -m "feat(tutorial): re-theme guide mob 9491 into Dewey"
```

## Task 4: Create the straw effigy practice mob (9614)

Attackable but harmless: `combat_passive` (can be attacked, never initiates),
`hostile: false`, `maxwander: 0` (stationary), high vitality so it survives the
lesson, species 19 (the dummy species — zero base damage). NOT `non_combatant`
(that flag makes a mob unattackable).

**Files:**
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9614-straw_effigy.yaml`
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9614-straw_effigy.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the effigy mob file**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9614-straw_effigy.yaml`:
```yaml
mobid: 9614
zone: Newcomer Antechamber
behavior_archetype: combat_passive
hostile: false
maxwander: 0
pack_flee_immune: true
statpool: 3
groups:
  - construct
activitylevel: 3
idlecommands:
  - 'emote sags on its post, straw whispering, then settles upright again'
  - ''
  - ''
character:
  name: Straw Effigy
  description: |
    A crude man-shape of bound straw and sackcloth lashed to a fixed post,
    faceless but for two charcoal smudges where eyes might be. It does not
    breathe and does not flinch until struck -- and it rights itself with a
    dry rustle every time, no worse for the beating. A safe thing to learn
    a fight against.
  speciesid: 19
  level: 1
  gold: 0
  stats:
    # Species 19 (dummy) has base vitality 200 and zero base damage. Add a
    # large vitality bump so the effigy cannot be killed during the short
    # scripted lesson (no engine "invulnerable" flag exists; high HP is the
    # mechanism). It deals no damage, so there is no time pressure on the player.
    vitality:
      training: 300
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the effigy goals file**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9614-straw_effigy.yaml`:
```yaml
mob_id: 9614
next_goal_id: 1
seeded_from_archetype: true
goals: []
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify both files parse**

Run: `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9614-straw_effigy.yaml')); yaml.safe_load(open('_datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9614-straw_effigy.yaml'))" && echo OK`
Expected: `OK`

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/newcomer_antechamber/9614-straw_effigy.yaml _datafiles/world/dogmud/goals/9614-straw_effigy.yaml
git commit -m "feat(tutorial): add straw effigy practice mob 9614"
```

## Task 5: Room 1 — The Threshold (6258): look → examine → move

Teaches `look`, then `look <noun>` (examine), then movement. Rich nouns because
this room *is* the examine lesson.

**Files:**

    finished arriving.
  grey: >-
    The grey has no walls and no distance; it simply is, in every direction.
    Not death, Dewey will tell you, and not quite life yet either -- the

    world.
  stone: >-
    A single worn threshold-stone sits underfoot, the one solid thing you can
    feel. Its surface is polished to a shine, hollowed slightly at the center
    by the passage of every soul who ever woke here and stepped through.
  dewey: >-
    Wiry, plain-dressed, patient -- and warm in a way nothing else here is.
    Dewey watches you with the easy attention of someone who has done this
    many times and still means it every time.

## Task 7: Room 3 — What You Carry (6260): get token → inventory → help

The grey token (`itemid: 2`) rests on the floor here (relocated from the old
6261).

    thing up stops being a mystery before the world hands you things that
    matter.

    A shallow niche worn into the grey, the sort of place a traveler leaves
    something for whoever comes next. Others have stood exactly here, learning
    exactly this.

    small grin. 'Better you learn where things go now, while it's only a token.'

## Task 9: Room 5 — The Proving (6262): the combat primer

The capstone. Gated sub-step chain: `warcried` → `saw_conditions` →
`checked_cooldowns` → `attacked` → `cast_spike` → `recast_blocked` → `tripped`
→ (grant_progression + primer) → `flee`/`north` out. The effigy (9614) and Dewey
(9491) both spawn here. The room has a **single forward `north` exit to 6467** (the
instance remaps it to the player's private copy). `flee`, taught as the last
lesson, moves the player along that only exit — forward, into The Landing — and
because the effigy is a floor-stat non-retaliator, flee succeeds reliably. No
lesson branch intercepts, so `warcry`/`conditions`/`cooldowns`/`attack`/`cast`/
`trip`/`flee` all run for real (the immediate recast of `cast spike` is genuinely
blocked by the engine, showing the real recover message). Movement and premature
`flee` are blocked only until `tripped`.

## Task 10: Room 6 — The Landing (6467): handoff to the Awakening Pool

New room. The player arrives here via `flee` from room 5 (the `move_player`
auto-queues a `look`, so the arrival prose shows immediately). The prose carries
Dewey's arrival line + the final `talk dewey` instruction; the tree intercepts
`talk`/`say` to vortex the player to room 5200 (mirrors the old 6262 terminus).

**Files:**
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/newcomer_antechamber/6467.yaml`
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/rooms/newcomer_antechamber/6467.yaml`

```yaml
roomid: 6467
zone: Newcomer Antechamber
title: The Landing
description: >
  The grey thins to almost nothing here, and ahead a pale blue-green light
  pools like the mouth of a well -- the real world, close enough to step into.
  Dewey is already waiting, unhurried. 'See? Still breathing,' Dewey says,
  smiling. 'You've got everything you need to start. When you're ready, type
  <ansi fg="command">talk dewey</ansi> and I'll send you through. The world's
  waiting.'
biome: default
exits: {}
spawninfo:
  - mobid: 9491
nouns:
  light: >-
    A pool of steady blue-green light hangs where the grey gives out -- the
    same glow you glimpsed under the still water, but whole and near now. It is
    the Awakening Pool, and the world around it, waiting for you to arrive.
  archway: >-
    Not so much a door as a thinning, a place where this grey between-world
    wears through into the real one. Step through it and you wake for good.
  dewey: >-
    Dewey stands easy at the threshold, hands in pockets. 'I stay here. There's
    always another one waking up. But you -- you go on. You'll do fine.'
idlemessages:
  - The pool of light ahead pulses once, slow and warm, like a welcome.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the room behavior tree**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/rooms/newcomer_antechamber/6467.yaml`:
```yaml
# 6467 The Landing — terminus. talk/say → farewell → vortex to the Awakening
# Pool (5200), where quest 30 begins with Cleric Hadwen. Intercept so the
# original talk/say doesn't re-run in 5200. Movement is caught and redirected.

## Task 11: Re-theme the guide dialogue tree into Dewey's voice

The dialogue file (keyed by mob id, filename stays `9491.yaml`) powers
`ask dewey <topic>` in room 4 and anywhere Dewey stands. Re-voice it as Dewey
(first person, warm) and add the topics the tutorial invites: world, pools, help,
look, conditions, growth/no-levels.

**Files:**
- Modify (overwrite): `_datafiles/world/dogmud/dialogue/newcomer_antechamber/9491.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Overwrite the dialogue file**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/dialogue/newcomer_antechamber/9491.yaml`:

  - keywords: ["world", "gaius", "outside", "beyond"]
    responses:
      - "Gaius. A whole living world -- a city, roads, people who lie and
          help and everything between. It changes while you're not looking.
          You'll love it and it'll scare you, both. That's right and proper."

  - keywords: ["pool", "pools", "health", "stamina", "conviction"]
    responses:
      - "Three pools sit under your six stats: health, stamina, conviction.
          Spend them and they refill with time and rest. Type

  - keywords: ["help", "command", "commands", "forget", "lost"]
    responses:
      - "Forget a command and the game remembers for you. Type
          <ansi fg=\"command\">help</ansi> for the whole index, or
          <ansi fg=\"command\">help</ansi> and a topic for one thing. No shame
          in it -- I still look things up."

  - keywords: ["look", "see", "examine", "read"]
    responses:
      - "Looking is the first skill and the last one you'll outgrow. Type
          <ansi fg=\"command\">look</ansi> in any room, and
          <ansi fg=\"command\">look</ansi> at anything that catches your eye.
          This world hides its best parts in plain sight."

  - keywords: ["condition", "conditions", "buff", "effect"]
    responses:
      - "Conditions are the temporary things riding on you -- a war cry
          steadying your hand, a poison in your blood, a leg swept out from
          under you. Good and bad both. Type
          <ansi fg=\"command\">conditions</ansi> to see what's on you."

  - keywords: ["grow", "growth", "level", "levels", "class", "progress", "mutation", "mutations"]
    responses:
      - "No levels here, and no class to cage you. You grow by *doing* --
          swing a blade and you sharpen, cast and you deepen, shout and you
          steady. Over time the way you fight even pulls mutations toward you.
          You never pick what you become. You earn it."

  - keywords: ["ready", "go", "leave", "through", "step", "done"]
    responses:
      - "Then don't let me keep you. Step on through when you reach the

  - keywords: [""]
    responses:
      - "Ask me about the world, the pools, conditions, how you'll grow -- or

## Task 12: Boot test + full walk-through verification

Data-file errors (name/filename mismatch, bad trigger, ID collision) only surface
at server startup and in play — this is the real acceptance gate.

- [ ] **Step 1: Full test + build**

Run: `go build ./... && go test ./internal/behaviortree/ -run TestGrantProgression`
Expected: build clean; tests PASS.

- [ ] **Step 2: Wipe instance saves (SOP)**

Run:
```bash
rm -rf _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs.instances/* _datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms.instances/*
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Boot the server and watch for a clean load**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dogmud-boot.log` (stop after startup completes)
Expected: no panic; lines like `mobs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=...`,
`rooms.LoadDataFiles() ...`, `dialogue ... loadedCount=...` appear. Specifically
confirm **no** `filesystem path ... did not end in Filepath()` panic (would mean
the Dewey mob/goals filename doesn't match the name field) and **no** unknown
behavior action/condition errors for `grant_progression`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Live walk-through (fresh character, route 1)**

Connect a client, create a new character, and choose **"1) New to text MUDs"**.
Walk all six rooms and confirm each gate + line. Verify in order:

- Room 6258: `look` → Dewey praises + prompts `look hands`; `look hands` → advances,
  north opens. Try `north` before examining → blocked with a nudge. Each noun
  (`look hands`, `look grey`, `look stone`, `look dewey`) returns lore prose.
  Every command word in Dewey's lines renders cyan.
- Room 6259: `status` → progression teaser; `north` gated until `status`.
- Room 6260: `get token` → `inventory` → `help`, each gated in order; `north`
  gated until `help`.
- Room 6261: `say hello` → `ask dewey world` (Dewey's dialogue answers AND the
  lesson advances); `north` gated until asked.
- Room 6262: `warcry` → the **Warcry** condition applies; `conditions` lists it
  with a countdown; `cooldowns` shows the special-move timer; `attack effigy`
  starts combat; `cast spike` hits; an **immediate** `cast spike` recast is
  **blocked** with the real recover message; after the well refills, `trip` lands
  and the effigy is **prone**; the **SKILL ADVANCEMENT** banner appears **once**;
  Dewey delivers the primer + flee prompt; `flee` carries you to room 6467. Confirm
  the effigy never dies and never flees, and that `flee` before `trip` is blocked.
- Room 6467: arrival prose shows Dewey's line; `talk dewey` vortexes you to room
  5200 (The Awakening Pool) with Cleric Hadwen present and quest 30 active
  (`quests` shows "The Awakening").

- [ ] **Step 5: If any step fails, fix the responsible file and re-run from Step 2.**
Common causes: a stale instance save shadowing an edit (re-run Step 2); a mismatched
mob filename vs `name:` (Task 3/4); a wrong command alias in a `command_matches`
list; `cast spike` needing an explicit target (if so, change the room-5 prompts and
`command_rest_contains` handling to `cast spike effigy`).

- [ ] **Step 6: Final commit (if fixes were needed)**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(tutorial): walk-through corrections for the newcomer antechamber"
```

---

## Notes for the implementer

- **Data > code here.** Only Task 1 is Go. Everything else is YAML the engine
  hot-loads at boot; there is no unit-test harness for room content — the boot
  test + walk-through (Task 12) is the acceptance gate. Do NOT skip the instance-
  save wipe before each boot, or stale saves will shadow your edits.
- **`cast spike` targeting.** In combat the caster should auto-target the current
  enemy. If the live walk-through shows `cast spike` demanding an explicit target,
  switch the room-5 copy and lesson to `cast spike effigy` (the
  `command_rest_contains: [spike]` check still matches). Flagged in Task 12 Step 5.
- **Effigy longevity.** If the walk-through ever kills the effigy, raise its
  `vitality.training` further (Task 4). There is no invulnerability flag; HP is the
  only lever.
- **Delays in room 5.** The `delay:` params on the post-`trip` lines sequence the
  "down it goes" line, the banner, the primer, and the flee prompt so they land in
  order after the trip resolves (same mechanism as the Hadwen rite). Adjust the
  offsets if the pacing feels off in play.
