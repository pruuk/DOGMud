# Fernway South Zone Build Implementation Plan (Stage 3.0c)

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the Fernway South zone — 20 rooms south of the existing Fernway zone, themed as deep forest tapering to the steppe edge. Adds 1 new species (mustelid), 6 mobs (5 reuse existing species, 1 uses the new species), and a single boundary-edit to Fox Den (4156) opening the south path.

**Architecture:** Pure data zone build — no Go code changes. 20 room YAMLs in a new `the_fernway_south/` folder, 1 species YAML, 6 mob YAMLs, 1 zone-config YAML, 1 boundary edit on the existing Fernway 4156 room, 1 coordinate map update, 1 PATCH_NOTES entry. Subagent-driven build is reliable as long as each task gives the implementer the exact roomid + coord + exit map so cartesian consistency is locked at the spec level (not the implementation level).

**Tech Stack:** YAML data files. Existing engine systems: room loader, mob loader, species registry, behavior_archetype dispatcher, spawn timer, coord/map renderer. No new code.

**Sketch (the durable design):** `docs/superpowers/plans/completed/2026-04-28-fernway-south-zone.md` (this file is both the plan and the sketch — there's no separate spec doc for this stage).

## Task 1: Add the mustelid species YAML

**Files:**
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/species/24-mustelid.yaml`

Real gap in the existing species set (we have rodent and canine but nothing for the mustelid family — badgers, weasels, otters, ferrets). ID 24 is the lowest unused gap (existing species jump from 23 aberration to 30 skeleton).

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm 24 is unused**

Run: `ls _datafiles/world/dogmud/species/24-*.yaml 2>/dev/null`
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the file**

```yaml
speciesid: 24
name: mustelid
description: |
  The mustelid family covers badgers, weasels, otters, ferrets, and
  martens — small to medium carnivores with thick muscular bodies,
  short legs, and a willingness to fight things twice their size.
  Heavy-jawed and stubborn; what they bite they tend to keep.
buffids:
  - 29 # Night Vision (mostly nocturnal hunters)
size: small
unarmedname: jaws
selectable: false
tameable: false
angrycommands:
  - 'emote bares its teeth and chitters a low warning'
  - 'emote hisses and arches its back'
  - 'emote snaps its jaws audibly'
stats:
  strength: {base: 70}
  dexterity: {base: 130}
  perception: {base: 110}
  vitality: {base: 90}
  willpower: {base: 25}
  charisma: {base: 10}
damage:
  basedamage: 6
  variance: 2
damage_multiplier: 0.55
disabledslots: [weapon, offhand, head, neck, belt, gloves, ring, legs, feet]
```

The vitality 90 + damage_multiplier 0.55 makes a small but tough fighter — appropriate for the badger-as-glass-cannon-but-not-soft profile. `tameable: false` because badgers are notoriously not pets.

- [ ] **Step 3: Boot test**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "species.LoadDataFiles|panic" | head -5` (timeout after ~30s).
Expected: `species.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=N` where N is one greater than the previous baseline. No panic.

If you get a panic about a duplicate species ID or a YAML parse error, fix and retry.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/species/24-mustelid.yaml
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(species): add mustelid (24) for badger + weasel + otter + ferret

Fills a real gap in the species set — no existing species covered the
mustelid family. Badger added as the first consumer in Stage 3.0c
Fernway South zone build.

## Task 2: Create the zone config + entry trio (rooms 4157–4159)

**Files:**
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/zone-config.yaml`
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4157.yaml`
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4158.yaml`
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4159.yaml`

The "entry trio" — Briar Tangle is the south-of-Fox-Den entry; Beewood Hollow (W) and Hare-Run Meadow (E) branch off it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the zone-config**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/zone-config.yaml`:

```yaml
name: The Fernway South
roomid: 4157
defaultbiome: forest
region: Windward Marches
```

`roomid` is the zone's spawn / entry room — Briar Tangle.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create 4157 Briar Tangle**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4157.yaml`:

```yaml
roomid: 4157
zone: The Fernway South
title: Briar Tangle
description: >
  [WRITE 4-7 sentence forest-prose description matching the existing
  Fernway voice (see the_fernway/4156.yaml for tone reference).
  THEME: just south of Fox Den the path narrows and snags with old
  bramble and thorn-windfalls. Senses: bramble dominant; thorn-cuts
  on the legs; deer-track packed beneath the bramble; smell of
  last season's leaf litter. The trail markers from Foxglade have
  stopped here. ANSI tags REQUIRED on these noun keywords:
  bramble, thorn-windfall, deer-track, leaf-litter — wrap each in
  <ansi fg="itemname">...</ansi>. Hard wrap at ~78 chars.]
biome: forest

  x: -14
  y: -15
  z: 0
exits:
  north:
    roomid: 4156
    zone: The Fernway
  south:
    roomid: 4160
  east:
    roomid: 4159
  west:
    roomid: 4158
nouns:
  bramble: |
    [1-2 sentence description. Old thorn-bramble densest along the
    eastern shoulder of the path.]
  thorn-windfall: |
    [1-2 sentences. Storm-fallen thorny boughs, half-rotted, snagged
    with last year's leaves.]
  deer-track: |
    [1-2 sentences. The packed earth underneath shows hoof-prints —
    deer use this trail more than humans do.]
  leaf-litter: |
    [1-2 sentences. Last autumn's leaves, brown and curl-edged,
    layered ankle-deep where the bramble shelters them.]
idlemessages:
  - '[idle: a wren flushes from the bramble and is gone]'
  - ''
  - '[idle: somewhere ahead, a fox barks once]'
  - ''
  - '[idle: a snagged twig breaks under settling weight]'
```

The bracketed `[WRITE ...]` and `[1-2 sentences ...]` blocks are directives, not literal placeholders — replace each with actual prose at write time. Match the voice of `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway/4156.yaml` (Fox Den) and `4151.yaml` (Bracken Mile). MUD line width 80 chars; no hard numbers in any text.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create 4158 Beewood Hollow**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4158.yaml`:

```yaml
roomid: 4158
zone: The Fernway South
title: Beewood Hollow
description: >
  [WRITE 4-7 sentences. THEME: a sunlit clearing west of Briar
  Tangle where wild honeybees nest in the hollows of old oaks.
  Senses: industrial bee-hum; wax-fat air; sun-warmth in a
  break of canopy; honey-smell faint but real. Required ANSI
  nouns: bee-tree, swarm, honeycomb, sun-patch.]
biome: forest
coord:
  x: -15
  y: -15
  z: 0
exits:
  east:
    roomid: 4157
nouns:
  bee-tree: |
    [1-2 sentences. A specific old oak with a wax-darkened hollow
    a body's-length up its trunk; bees come and go in steady traffic.]
  swarm: |
    [1-2 sentences. Hundreds of honeybees, wholly absorbed in the
    work of returning and departing.]
  honeycomb: |
    [1-2 sentences. Visible at the lip of the bee-tree's hollow,
    darkened with old wax.]
  sun-patch: |
    [1-2 sentences. The break in the canopy that opens this hollow
    to the sky and to the bees' need for warmth.]
idlemessages:
  - '[idle: a single bee hovers in front of you, then is gone]'
  - ''
  - '[idle: the hum of the swarm rises and falls]'
  - ''
  - '[idle: a wax-flake drifts down and lands on the leaf litter]'
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Create 4159 Hare-Run Meadow**

`_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4159.yaml`:

```yaml
roomid: 4159
zone: The Fernway South
title: Hare-Run Meadow
description: >
  [WRITE 4-7 sentences. THEME: a small grass-edged forest meadow
  east of Briar Tangle, threaded with hare-runs through the cover.
  Senses: long meadow-grass; cropped hare-paths; sky open overhead
  for the first time since Foxglade; cool damp earth under the
  paths. Required ANSI nouns: meadow-grass, hare-path, droppings,
  open-sky.]
biome: forest
coord:
  x: -13
  y: -15
  z: 0
exits:
  west:
    roomid: 4157
nouns:
  meadow-grass: |
    [1-2 sentences. Knee-high meadow grass at the edges; cropped
    short along the hare-paths.]
  hare-path: |
    [1-2 sentences. A network of low cropped paths through the
    grass — clearly the work of small fast feet.]
  droppings: |
    [1-2 sentences. Fresh hare droppings along the path edges.]
  open-sky: |
    [1-2 sentences. The first real opening overhead since the
    forest closed in north of Fox Den.]
idlemessages:
  - '[idle: a hare freezes briefly at the meadow edge, then bolts]'
  - ''
  - '[idle: meadow grass bends in a passing wind]'
  - ''
  - '[idle: a hawk shadow crosses the open patch]'
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Boot test the trio + zone-config**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "rooms.LoadDataFiles|panic|the_fernway_south" | head -10` (timeout 30s).
Expected: `rooms.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=N` increases by 3. A `New Mapper zone="The Fernway South-4157"` line appears with size=3. No panic.

If the loader complains about a missing exit target (4160/etc.), that's expected at this stage — we only created 4157-4159 so the south exit from 4157 points at a not-yet-existing 4160. The loader logs a warning but doesn't panic. We'll fill in the rest in subsequent tasks.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(rooms): Fernway South entry trio (4157-4159) + zone config

Briar Tangle (entry from Fox Den), Beewood Hollow (W, bees), and
Hare-Run Meadow (E, hares). Zone metadata committed alongside.
Stage 3.0c.

    patches that catch the sun.]
  mushrooms: |
    [1-2 sentences. Pale-capped fungi clustered along the logs'
    damp undersides — shadowcaps and a few less-edible cousins.]
  saplings: |
    [1-2 sentences. Young oaks and birches racing for the canopy
    gap left by the burn; some already shoulder-high.]
idlemessages:

    the trunks — the kind smiths and alchemists prize.]
  needle-carpet: |

    dry, that mute every footstep.]
  wolf-sign: |
    [1-2 sentences. A scratched-up patch on one of the pines and
    a single tuft of grey fur snagged on the bark — something
    large and four-legged uses this stand.]
idlemessages:
  - '[idle: a pine needle drifts down]'

    the wallow — recent, some still fresh-rimmed.]
  scratching-tree: |
    [1-2 sentences. An old oak at the wallow's edge with bark
    rubbed smooth at boar-shoulder height.]
  flies: |
    [1-2 sentences. A persistent low cloud of small flies; brushed

  beech-mast: |
    [1-2 sentences. The thick layer of fallen beech-nuts and
    leaf-litter underfoot — a deer larder.]
  dappled-light: |
    [1-2 sentences. The fused canopy filters sunlight into
    shifting green patches that move with the breeze.]
  path-junction: |

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Boot test**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "the_fernway_south|panic" | head -5`.
Expected: zone size now reads 7 (3 from Task 2 + 4 from Task 3). No panic. Some "exit target not found" warnings are still expected (4163 → 4170, 4167, 4164 don't exist yet).

    the kind of warning every other forest animal heeds.]

    center, tall purple-pink spikes hung with thimble-shaped
    flowers — beautiful and famously poisonous.]
  flower-spike: |
    [1-2 sentences. Each foxglove sends up one or two tall
    flower-spikes laden with the characteristic thimble blooms,
    deepening from white at the throat to dark purple at the

- [ ] **Step 8: Boot test the full zone**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "the_fernway_south|panic" | head -10`.
Expected: `New Mapper zone="The Fernway South-4157" size=20`. No panic. No "exit target not found" warnings (every internal exit now has a corresponding room).

There WILL still be one warning: 4157 → 4156 (Fox Den) is an EXTERNAL exit and the loader may grumble that 4156 doesn't link back. That's intentional — the boundary edit on Fox Den happens in Task 8.

## Task 7: Create the 6 mob YAMLs

**Files:**

- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/the_fernway_south/361-roe_deer.yaml`

- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/the_fernway_south/365-forest_badger.yaml`

**Folder note:** the mobs folder uses the same zone-folder name as the rooms folder — `the_fernway_south/`. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.

**Aggro design summary** (re-stating because it's the most important constraint):

| Mob | hostile | groups | hates | Aggro behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| wild hare | false | [animal, rodent] | (none) | flees on sight (prey archetype) |
| roe deer | false | [animal, deer] | (none) | flees on sight (prey archetype) |
| honey bees | false | [animal, insectoid, swarm] | (none) | passive; sting if attacked |
| feral boar | false | [animal, boar] | (none) | passive; fights HARD if attacked |
| timber wolf | false | [animal, canine, predator] | [boar] | NOT player-hostile; engages boars on sight |
| forest badger | true | [animal, mustelid] | (none) | hostile to ALL on sight |

The wolf's `hostile: false` + `hates: [boar]` is the key emergent dynamic — verified working pattern via `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/ironwind_steppe/205-steppe_wolf.yaml`.

`itemid: 40064` is wild hare meat (existing Fernway mat from 3.0b). `itemdropchance: 75` is the overall drop trigger (most kills yield meat, some don't); the loot table is the single `items:` entry above.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create 361 roe deer**

```yaml
mobid: 361
zone: The Fernway South
behavior_archetype: prey
archetype: fighting
statpool: 60
itemdropchance: 60
hostile: false
charm_immune: false
maxwander: 4
groups:
  - animal
  - deer
  - prey
items:
  - itemid: 40064
idlecommands:
  - 'emote lifts its head from browse, ears swivelling'
  - ''
  - 'emote takes two careful steps and stops'
  - ''
  - 'emote crops a low birch-leaf and chews slowly'
  - ''
activitylevel: 25
character:
  name: roe deer
  description: |
    A small deer of the forest interior — neat, reddish-brown in
    summer coat, with a pale rump-patch and large ears. It stops
    moving when you do, and watches you with the absolute
    stillness of an animal that has learned humans bring no good.
  speciesid: 7
  level: 2
  gold: 0
  stats:
    strength:
      training: 10
    dexterity:
      training: 16
    perception:
      training: 14
    vitality:
      training: 12
```

Reuses wild-hare-meat as the meat drop (no separate "venison" item — keeps the mat pool clean per the brief).

- [ ] **Step 3: Create 362 honey bees**

```yaml
mobid: 362
zone: The Fernway South
behavior_archetype: combat_passive
archetype: fighting
statpool: 15
itemdropchance: 50
hostile: false
charm_immune: true
maxwander: 0
groups:
  - animal
  - insectoid
  - swarm
items:
  - itemid: 40065
idlecommands:
  - "emote works the bee-tree's hollow in steady traffic"
  - ''
  - 'emote returns to the hollow heavy with pollen'
  - ''
activitylevel: 50
character:
  name: honey bees
  description: |
    A working swarm of wild honeybees — hundreds of small
    industrious bodies in steady traffic between the bee-tree
    and the meadow. Approached calmly they ignore you. Disturb
    the swarm and you will not enjoy the next minute of your
    life.
  speciesid: 12
  level: 1
  gold: 0
  stats:
    strength:
      training: 4
    dexterity:
      training: 14
    perception:
      training: 12
    vitality:
      training: 10
```

`itemid: 40065` is beeswax. `maxwander: 0` keeps the swarm rooted at the bee-tree. `charm_immune: true` because charming a hive-mind is silly.

- [ ] **Step 4: Create 363 feral boar**

```yaml
mobid: 363
zone: The Fernway South
behavior_archetype: combat_passive
archetype: fighting
statpool: 90
itemdropchance: 80
hostile: false
charm_immune: false
maxwander: 2
groups:
  - animal
  - boar
items:
  - itemid: 40064
idlecommands:
  - 'emote roots in the wallow mud with its snout'
  - ''
  - 'emote scratches its flank against the wallow tree'
  - ''
  - 'emote grunts low and continues rooting'
  - ''
activitylevel: 20
character:
  name: feral boar
  description: |
    A wild forest pig, big-shouldered and grey-bristled, snout
    caked with the wallow mud. It watches you with small mean
    eyes and continues working at the mud. Don't startle it.
  speciesid: 6
  level: 4
  gold: 0
  stats:
    strength:
      training: 18
    dexterity:
      training: 8
    perception:
      training: 10
    vitality:
      training: 20
```

High vitality + strength so it hits hard if engaged. `combat_passive` (not `prey`) because if attacked it fights, doesn't flee.

- [ ] **Step 5: Create 364 timber wolf** *(the key non-hostile-to-player mob)*

```yaml
mobid: 364
zone: The Fernway South
behavior_archetype: generic_fighter
archetype: fighting
statpool: 80
itemdropchance: 0
hostile: false
charm_immune: false
maxwander: 5
groups:
  - animal
  - canine
  - predator
hates:
  - boar
idlecommands:
  - 'emote pads silently between the pine trunks, scenting'
  - ''
  - 'emote lifts its muzzle and tests the wind'
  - ''
  - 'emote stops and listens, head cocked'
  - ''
activitylevel: 30
character:
  name: timber wolf
  description: |
    A lone grey timber wolf, lean and tall-shouldered, moving
    through the pine stand like it belongs to the trees. It
    does not look at you the way it looks at smaller things.
    Whatever it came south for, it isn't you.
  speciesid: 2
  level: 5
  gold: 0
  stats:
    strength:
      training: 14
    dexterity:
      training: 16
    perception:
      training: 18
    vitality:
      training: 14
```

**KEY:** `hostile: false` (will not attack player) + `hates: [boar]` (will engage any boar in range). `maxwander: 5` lets the wolf roam between Pine Stand (4161) and Boar Wallow (4162) via Old Burn Scar (4160), enabling the emergent wolf-vs-boar combat.

No loot — the wolf is wildlife flavor, not a kill target. (If you do kill it, no loot drops; that's intentional design.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Create 365 forest badger** *(the only player-hostile mob)*

```yaml
mobid: 365
zone: The Fernway South
behavior_archetype: generic_fighter
archetype: fighting
statpool: 70
itemdropchance: 0
hostile: true
charm_immune: false
maxwander: 1
groups:
  - animal
  - mustelid
idlecommands:
  - 'emote bares its teeth and chitters from a burrow mouth'
  - ''
  - 'emote stalks a tight circle at the sett edge'
  - ''
  - 'emote drags a small bone deeper into the burrow'
  - ''
activitylevel: 25
character:
  name: forest badger
  description: |
    A sett-defending forest badger — black-and-white striped face,
    short heavy body, claws that mean it. Smaller than you
    expected. Meaner than you expected. The musk-smell tells you
    it has not retreated.
  speciesid: 24
  level: 3
  gold: 0
  stats:
    strength:
      training: 12
    dexterity:
      training: 16
    perception:
      training: 14
    vitality:
      training: 18
```

`speciesid: 24` is the new mustelid species from Task 1. `hostile: true` + no `hates:` means it attacks anything in its room — players, other mobs, everyone. `maxwander: 1` keeps it centered on the sett (4172).

No loot for the same reason as wolf — flavor, not farm bait. (If a future stage wants badger pelts as a quest item, layer in then.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Boot test the mobs**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "mobs.LoadDataFiles|panic" | head -5`.
Expected: `mobs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=N` increases by 6. No panic. If panic about unknown speciesid 24, Task 1 didn't land — fix that first.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/the_fernway_south/
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(mobs): Fernway South wildlife (mobs 360-365)

6 mobs for the new zone:
- 360 wild hare (prey, rodent)
- 361 roe deer (prey, deer)
- 362 honey bees (combat_passive, insectoid swarm)
- 363 feral boar (combat_passive, boar; hits hard if engaged)
- 364 timber wolf (generic_fighter, canine; NOT player-hostile,
  hates boars — emergent intra-zone hunt dynamic)
- 365 forest badger (generic_fighter, mustelid 24; the only true
  hostile in the zone)

Stage 3.0c.

## Task 8: Spawninfo wiring + Fox Den boundary edit

**Files:**
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4158.yaml` (bees spawn)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4159.yaml` (hare spawn)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4161.yaml` (wolf spawn)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4162.yaml` (boar spawn)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4167.yaml` (deer spawn — Browse)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4169.yaml` (deer spawn — Salt Lick)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4172.yaml` (badger spawn)
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway/4156.yaml` (Fox Den south exit)

**Spawn distribution recap:**

| Room | Mob | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|
| 4158 Beewood Hollow | 362 honey bees | 600 rounds |
| 4159 Hare-Run Meadow | 360 wild hare | 300 rounds |
| 4161 Pine Stand | 364 timber wolf | 1200 rounds |
| 4162 Boar Wallow | 363 feral boar | 900 rounds |
| 4167 Deer Browse | 361 roe deer | 600 rounds |
| 4169 Salt Lick | 361 roe deer | 600 rounds |
| 4172 Badger Sett | 365 forest badger | 1800 rounds |

Higher cooldowns for the rarer / tougher mobs (wolf, badger).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add spawninfo to 4158 (bees)**

In `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/4158.yaml`, append at the BOTTOM of the file (after `idlemessages`):

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 362
  cooldown: 600 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add spawninfo to 4159 (hare)**

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 360
  cooldown: 300 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add spawninfo to 4161 (wolf)**

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 364
  cooldown: 1200 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add spawninfo to 4162 (boar)**

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 363
  cooldown: 900 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add spawninfo to 4167 (deer at Browse)**

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 361
  cooldown: 600 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Add spawninfo to 4169 (deer at Salt Lick)**

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 361
  cooldown: 600 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Add spawninfo to 4172 (badger)**

```yaml
spawninfo:
- mobid: 365
  cooldown: 1800 rounds
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Edit Fox Den 4156 to add the south exit**

In `_datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway/4156.yaml`, locate the `exits:` block (currently has only a north exit). Replace:

```yaml
exits:
  north:
    roomid: 4152
```

with:

```yaml
exits:
  north:
    roomid: 4152
  south:
    roomid: 4157
    zone: The Fernway South
```

YAML indentation is 2-space; the `roomid` and `zone` lines must be indented one level deeper than `south:`.

- [ ] **Step 9: Boot test**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "the_fernway|panic|exit" | head -20`.
Expected:
- No panic
- The Fernway South zone size 20 (unchanged)
- The Fernway zone size 10 (unchanged)
- No "exit target not found" warnings on either zone
- No instance saves committed (run `git status` and confirm no `mobs.instances/`, `rooms.instances/`, `shops/` files appear)

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway_south/ _datafiles/world/dogmud/rooms/the_fernway/4156.yaml
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(spawn): Fernway South spawninfo + Fox Den south exit

Spawn distribution: bees in Beewood Hollow, hare in Hare-Run, wolf
in Pine Stand, boar in Boar Wallow, deer in Browse + Salt Lick,
badger in Sett. Rare-mob cooldowns longer (wolf 1200, badger 1800).

Fox Den (4156) gains south→4157 exit with cross-zone target. Stage 3.0c.

## Task 9: coordinate_map.md update + PATCH_NOTES + smoke handoff

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/coordinate_map.md`
- Modify: `PATCH_NOTES.md`

The coord map is currently STALE — it doesn't include the existing Fernway zone (4147-4156). This task brings it current AND adds the new Fernway South.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add 30 rows to coordinate_map.md**

Open `docs/coordinate_map.md`. The table sorts by room ID. The 4xxx range falls AFTER the existing Watchers Crossing (~line 237: row `| 427 | Watchers Crossing | ...`) and BEFORE the next zone block.

Find the current insertion point (the row immediately after `| 427 | Watchers Crossing | Watchers Crossing, East Road | -5 | 0 | 0 |`). Insert the following 30 rows in numeric ID order:

```
| 4147 | The Fernway | Fernway, Eastern Trailhead | -9 | -13 | 0 |
| 4148 | The Fernway | Stoneford Crossing | -10 | -13 | 0 |
| 4149 | The Fernway | Twin Oaks Bend | -11 | -13 | 0 |
| 4150 | The Fernway | Heron Reach | -12 | -13 | 0 |
| 4151 | The Fernway | Bracken Mile | -13 | -13 | 0 |
| 4152 | The Fernway | Foxglade | -14 | -13 | 0 |
| 4153 | The Fernway | Fernway, Western Trailhead | -15 | -13 | 0 |
| 4154 | The Fernway | Old Weddell Farmstead | -16 | -13 | 0 |
| 4155 | The Fernway | Heron Pond | -15 | -12 | 0 |
| 4156 | The Fernway | Fox Den | -14 | -14 | 0 |
| 4157 | The Fernway South | Briar Tangle | -14 | -15 | 0 |
| 4158 | The Fernway South | Beewood Hollow | -15 | -15 | 0 |
| 4159 | The Fernway South | Hare-Run Meadow | -13 | -15 | 0 |
| 4160 | The Fernway South | Old Burn Scar | -14 | -16 | 0 |
| 4161 | The Fernway South | Pine Stand | -13 | -16 | 0 |
| 4162 | The Fernway South | Boar Wallow | -15 | -16 | 0 |
| 4163 | The Fernway South | Twin Beech Glade | -14 | -17 | 0 |
| 4164 | The Fernway South | Brook Rise | -15 | -17 | 0 |
| 4165 | The Fernway South | Heron Pool | -15 | -18 | 0 |
| 4166 | The Fernway South | Watercress Bend | -15 | -19 | 0 |
| 4167 | The Fernway South | Deer Browse | -13 | -17 | 0 |
| 4168 | The Fernway South | Birch Stand | -13 | -18 | 0 |
| 4169 | The Fernway South | Salt Lick | -13 | -19 | 0 |
| 4170 | The Fernway South | Tangled Bracken | -14 | -18 | 0 |
| 4171 | The Fernway South | Old Stand | -14 | -19 | 0 |
| 4172 | The Fernway South | Badger Sett | -15 | -21 | 0 |
| 4173 | The Fernway South | Foxglove Clearing | -13 | -21 | 0 |
| 4174 | The Fernway South | Twisted Hawthorn | -14 | -21 | 0 |
| 4175 | The Fernway South | Steppe Edge | -14 | -22 | 0 |
| 4176 | The Fernway South | Birdsong Glade | -14 | -20 | 0 |
```

Verify Fernway coords against actual room files — values above are read from the YAMLs at plan-write time.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update the "Total reachable" header line**

The current line says `Total reachable: 274 rooms across multiple zones`. After adding 30 rows (10 Fernway catch-up + 20 Fernway South), the number should be `Total reachable: 304 rooms across multiple zones`. (Adjust if the actual current count differs from 274 — re-count or run `go run . 2>&1 | grep "reachable"` if there's a server-side count emitted at boot.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Update the coord range summary**

Find the `## Coordinate Range Summary` block (currently around line 417). Update the Y range:

Old:
```
- Y range: -14 to 11 (height: 26)
```

New:
```
- Y range: -22 to 11 (height: 34)
```

X range and Z range stay the same (the new zone fits within X -15 to -13, Z 0 — both already covered).

- [ ] **Step 4: Add Stage 3.0c entry to PATCH_NOTES.md**

After the title `# DOGMud Patch Notes` and above the existing 2026-04-28 Stage 3.0d entry, insert:

```markdown
## 2026-04-28 — Stage 3.0c: Fernway South Zone (dev only)

**Note:** Dev-only landing. The full economy stack ships to prod (`master`)
as a coherent update once Stage 3.4 lands.

- New 20-room zone south of the existing Fernway, themed as deep
  forest tapering to the steppe edge. Connects from Fox Den (4156)
  via a new south exit; terminates at Steppe Edge (4175, biome:
  plains) with a one-way view of the Dustwalk beyond.
- New mustelid species (24) — fills a real gap in the species set
  (we had rodent and canine but nothing for badgers, weasels,
  otters). First consumer is the forest badger; future zones with
  otters or weasels reuse immediately.
- Six new wildlife mobs (360-365): wild hare, roe deer, honey bees,
  feral boar, timber wolf, forest badger. Only the badger is
  hostile to players — the rest are atmosphere or forage support.
  Wolf is `hostile: false` but `hates: [boar]` — emergent
  intra-zone hunt dynamic where the wolf may engage boars without
  threatening the player.
- The 6 existing Fernway forage mats (oak bark, shadowcap mushroom,
  wild hare meat, beeswax, blood-moss, pine pitch from 3.0b) gain
  fresh territory to spawn in. No new mats added.
- Stage 3.0c is the territory groundwork for Stage 3.1 forager
  NPCs — the forest is now big enough for a Fernway-based forager
  to wander, gather, and recall to depot when injured.

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Final boot + smoke handoff**

Run: `go build ./... && go test ./... 2>&1 | tail -5`.
Expected: clean build, all tests pass.

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | grep -E "panic|the_fernway_south|reachable" | head -10`.
Expected: zone loads at size 20, no panic, no missing-exit warnings.

**Manual smoke checklist** (per `docs/CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` Section 2 — defer to user):

```
[ ] Walk every room (4157-4176). Each title and description reads
    cleanly (no missing punctuation, broken ANSI tags, dropped
    sentences, surviving [WRITE ...] directives).
[ ] Verified every exit. Every room reachable; one-way terminal
    south at 4175 is intentional.
[ ] No mapsymbol/maplegend on any non-landmark room. (None should be
    set in this zone — verify with grep.)
[ ] Cartesian consistency: run `map` from a few spread-out rooms,
    confirm no overlap with adjacent existing zones (Fernway is the
    only neighbor; no overlap possible since the new zone occupies
    Y < -14 territory previously empty).
[ ] Fight ≥1 mob of each combat archetype used in the zone:
    - prey (wild hare or roe deer — should flee on sight)
    - combat_passive (honey bees or feral boar — passive until hit)
    - generic_fighter (timber wolf — should NOT attack on sight;
      forest badger — SHOULD attack on sight)
[ ] Spawn the wolf and a boar in the same area (4160-4162 corridor)
    and watch — wolf should engage boar via the hates list.
[ ] Kill at least one mob (boar or badger) and loot the corpse.
    Confirm wild hare meat or beeswax drops where wired.
[ ] Identify a forage mat from the existing Fernway pool (e.g.,
    pick up a beeswax drop, run `identify`). Stats render cleanly,
    no raw numbers leak.
[ ] No instance saves committed: `rooms.instances/the_fernway_south/`,
    `mobs.instances/`, `shops/` should NOT appear in `git status`.
[ ] go build ./... clean. go test ./... clean.
```

When all 10 boxes tick, Stage 3.0c is done. Phase 2 quests (if any) come in a separate pass — likely deferred to align with Stage 3.1 forager wiring.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/coordinate_map.md PATCH_NOTES.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(3.0c): coord map catch-up + Fernway South + patch notes

- coordinate_map.md: added 10 missing Fernway rows (catch-up; the
  doc was stale before this) plus 20 Fernway South rows. Y range
  summary extended from -14 to -22.
- PATCH_NOTES: Stage 3.0c dev-only entry.

```

---

## Out of scope reminder (push back if scope creep tries to add)

- **Quests in this zone** — Phase 2 work, deferred. Aligns naturally with Stage 3.1 forager wiring.
- **New foragable mats** — the existing 6 Fernway mats (40062-40067) are the supply pool.
- **New zone-specific items** — no curio loot (boar tusk, badger pelt) per user direction.
- **3.0a (west-of-Stillwater zone)** — separate Stage. Sequence after 3.0c.
- **Forager NPCs** — Stage 3.1 work. The territory exists; the NPC will be wired separately.

## Done = ?

All 9 tasks complete, all commits landed on `development` branch, manual smoke (Step 5 of Task 9) all green. Per the multi-stage caravan/economy effort: this lands on `development` only. Nothing ships to `master` until Stage 3.4 lands.
