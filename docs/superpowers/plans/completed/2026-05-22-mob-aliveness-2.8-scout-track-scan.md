# Mob Aliveness 2.8 — Scout / Track / Scan Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Lift `scan`, `track`, and `search` into `internal/actions/` via the actor pattern; add three btree action primitives + one chase-consumer + two conditions; wire a new `scout` archetype on goblin_scout (217); graft scan-before-ambush onto `lookout`, search-before-steal onto `thief`, and track-on-aggro-lost onto `leader`. Fix the latent buff-26-misuse bug discovered during plan-writing by authoring a real Active Tracking buff (86) and migrating the player code to it.

**Architecture:** Three actions in `internal/actions/{scan,track,search}.go` with `Verb(actor Actor, opts) Result` signatures (2.7 pattern). Thin player wrappers in `usercommands/`. Mob wrappers in `mobcommands/`. Btree primitives in `behaviortree/actions_scout.go` + `conditions_scout.go`. Active tracking persists via `tracking-user`/`tracking-mob` misc-data on the actor's `Character`, plus buff 86 as a 16-round duration token (introspection + auto-expiry). `move_toward_tracked` reads the misc data each tick and dispatches `go <direction>`.

**Tech Stack:** Go, GoMud engine, YAML data files. TDD with `go test`.

---

## Plan-writing discovery — buff 26 is Conviction Surge

During plan-writing I verified that `_datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/26-conviction_surge.yaml` is the only YAML with `buffid: 26`. The comment in `skill.track.go:267,284,312,329` claiming `// 26 is the buff for active tracking` is wrong. Today, when a player runs `track <name>` and rolls high enough for active tracking, the engine silently applies Conviction Surge (+15 strength, 16 rounds, damage-bonus flag). The `roomdetails.go` "tracking direction" rendering is gated by `tracking-user`/`tracking-mob` misc-data, NOT by `HasBuff(26)` — verified by reading the surrounding control flow at `roomdetails.go:413-520`.

**This plan fixes the bug as part of 2.8.** Task 1 authors buff 86 (Active Tracking — no statmods, 16-round duration). Tasks 2-3 migrate the four player-side `AddBuff(26)` calls and five player-side `RemoveBuff(26)` calls to use 86. The mob-side path uses 86 for the same purpose.

Throughout this plan, references to "the tracking buff" mean buff 86 (authored in Task 1), not buff 26.

## Implementation order rationale

1. **Buff infrastructure first (Tasks 1-3):** Derisks the symmetric-buff piece *and* fixes the player bug before any new consumer is wired.
2. **Actions package lifts (Tasks 4-6):** Source-of-truth code for the three verbs. TDD per file. Self-contained, no cross-task dependencies.
3. **Player wrappers thin (Tasks 7-9):** Each depends only on its corresponding action.
4. **Mob wrappers (Task 10):** Depends on actions; trivially small.
5. **Btree primitives (Tasks 11-12):** Depends on actions. Adds the four action primitives + two conditions.
6. **Archetype YAMLs (Tasks 13-16):** Depends on btree primitives. Each graft is independent.
7. **Shadow parity + universal cleanup hooks (Tasks 17-20):** Buff 87 authoring + shadow.go audit + the two cleanup hooks. Lands BEFORE docs/smoke because the smoke plan exercises the cleanup paths.
8. **Docs + smoke (Tasks 21-22):** context.md updates + the smoke plan (13 scenarios, including the 4 escape-gate regressions).

## Phase 1 — Tracking buff infrastructure

### Task 1: Author `86-active_tracking.yaml`

**Files:**
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/86-active_tracking.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the buff YAML**

Write `_datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/86-active_tracking.yaml` with this content:

```yaml
buffid: 86
name: Active Tracking
description: You are following a quarry's trail with heightened awareness.
triggerrate: 1 round
triggercount: 25
start_user_text: You commit the trail to memory and steady your senses.
end_user_text: The trail grows cold; your focus slips.
```

No statmods, no flags. Pure duration token + introspection state. Filename derives via `ConvertForFilename("Active Tracking")` → `active_tracking` (per CLAUDE.md naming SOP).

- [ ] **Step 2: Boot the server and confirm the buff loads**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -120`

Expected: server boots past `buffs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=70` (previously 69). No panics. Kill the server after confirmation (Ctrl+C / process kill).

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/86-active_tracking.yaml
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(buffs): add 86 Active Tracking (replaces buff-26 misuse)

Authored buffid 86 with no statmods + 16-round duration. Replaces
the latent misuse of buff 26 (Conviction Surge) in skill.track.go,
which was silently giving players a +15 strength combat buff while
active tracking was on.

)"
```

### Task 2: Migrate player track.go AddBuff(26)→AddBuff(86)

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/usercommands/skill.track.go:267,284,312,329`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace all four AddBuff(26) calls with AddBuff(86)**

Use Edit tool on `internal/usercommands/skill.track.go`. There are four sites, each with the same `old_string` body:

```go
				user.AddBuff(26, `skill`) // 26 is the buff for active tracking
```

Replace each with:

```go
				user.AddBuff(86, `skill`) // 86 is the Active Tracking buff
```

Use `replace_all: true` since all four occurrences are identical.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build to confirm no compile breakage**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit, no errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/usercommands/skill.track.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(track): point active tracking at buff 86, not Conviction Surge

Previously skill.track.go applied AddBuff(26) on a successful active
track. Buff 26 is Conviction Surge (+15 strength, 16-round combat
buff) — players were silently getting a damage bonus for running
recon. Migrated to buff 86 (Active Tracking, no statmods).

)"
```

### Task 3: Migrate roomdetails.go RemoveBuff(26)→RemoveBuff(86) AND fix "tracking forever" bug

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/rooms/roomdetails.go:413-520` (the two tracking-render blocks)

**Historical context (must read):** Players previously reported a "tracking message never goes away" bug. Root cause: the rendering blocks at `roomdetails.go:413` (tracking-mob) and `:474` (tracking-user) gate only on misc data (`if searchMobName := user.Character.GetMiscData('tracking-mob'); searchMobName != nil`). The five `RemoveBuff(26)` call sites within those blocks remove the buff and clear `tracking-display-count` but do NOT clear `tracking-mob` / `tracking-user`. Once those misc keys are set (during `skill.track.go`'s active-track success path), the only way to clear them is via explicit `track stop/clear`. When the buff expires naturally — or when target is found / trail is lost via the existing logic — the misc data persists and the render keeps firing. The previous attempt to fix this likely chose buff 26 (Conviction Surge) specifically for its 16-round expiry, then forgot to wire the misc-data cleanup on buff expiry.

This task fixes both the buff-id migration and the misc-data leak.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify the call sites with grep**

Run: `Grep` tool with pattern `RemoveBuff\(26\)` in path `internal/rooms/roomdetails.go`, output_mode `content`, `-n: true`.

Expected: ~five-to-six matches (verified during plan-writing was five — recheck).

- [ ] **Step 2: At every site that calls RemoveBuff(26), also clear tracking misc data**

For each of the five `RemoveBuff(26)` sites (lines 421, 439, 449, 481, 499, 509 — re-verify line numbers), the migration becomes a three-line block, not a one-line replace:

**Before:**
```go
user.Character.RemoveBuff(26)
user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-display-count", nil)
```

**After:**
```go
user.Character.RemoveBuff(86)
user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-display-count", nil)
user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-mob", nil)
user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-user", nil)
```

Use Edit tool on each site individually (sites are not identical — some appear in the tracking-mob block, some in the tracking-user block — but the cleanup pattern is the same: clear BOTH misc keys at every cleanup site, since at most one is set anyway and a nil-clear is a no-op).

- [ ] **Step 3: Add a HasBuff(86) outer gate to BOTH tracking-render blocks**

This is the structural fix for "tracking forever." At `roomdetails.go:413` (the tracking-mob block) and `:474` (the tracking-user block), wrap the existing `if searchMobName ... != nil { ... }` body with a buff-presence check. If misc data is set but the buff is absent (buff expired or otherwise removed without cleanup), clear the misc data and render nothing.

**Before** (paraphrased structure):
```go
if searchMobName := user.Character.GetMiscData(`tracking-mob`); searchMobName != nil {
    if searchMobNameStr, ok := searchMobName.(string); ok {
        // ... rendering logic ...
    }
}
```

**After:**
```go
if searchMobName := user.Character.GetMiscData(`tracking-mob`); searchMobName != nil {
    // Buff-absent cleanup: if tracking misc data was set but the
    // active-tracking buff expired or was removed, drop the misc
    // data so the render doesn't fire forever.
    if !user.Character.HasBuff(86) {
        user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-mob", nil)
        user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-user", nil)
        user.Character.SetMiscData("tracking-display-count", nil)
    } else if searchMobNameStr, ok := searchMobName.(string); ok {
        // ... existing rendering logic unchanged ...
    }
}
```

Apply the same pattern to the tracking-user block at line ~474.

The buff's natural-expiry text ("The trail grows cold; your focus slips.") fires automatically when buff 86 expires per the YAML's `end_user_text`. The misc-data cleanup runs on the next room view (essentially the next player action), making the cleanup observably tied to the buff lifecycle from the player's POV.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build to confirm no compile breakage**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit, no errors.

- [ ] **Step 5: Spot-check with grep**

Confirm no remaining `RemoveBuff(26)` references in non-Conviction-Surge contexts:

```bash
# Inside Grep tool:
pattern: "RemoveBuff\\(26\\)|AddBuff\\(26\\)"
output_mode: "content"
-n: true
```

Expected: zero matches (all migrated to 86). If any remain, they need migration too.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/rooms/roomdetails.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(rooms): cleanup tracking misc data on buff absence + on stop sites

Fixes the long-standing "tracking message never goes away" bug.
The render blocks at lines 413/474 previously gated only on misc
data, while the buff (now 86) was the only auto-expiry mechanism.
When the buff expired, misc data persisted and the render kept
firing forever.

Adds a HasBuff(86) outer gate that clears misc data on buff
absence. Also clears tracking-mob/tracking-user at every existing
RemoveBuff site (target-found / trail-lost) so the cleanup
contract is symmetric.

```

## Phase 2 — Actions package lifts

### Task 4: Lift Scan into actions/scan.go (TDD)

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/actions/scan.go`
- Create: `internal/actions/scan_test.go`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `internal/actions/scan_test.go`:

```go
package actions

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
)

// TestScan_EmptyAdjacentRooms confirms Scan returns an empty Sightings
// slice (not nil) when the actor's room has no visible exits or all
// adjacent rooms are empty.
func TestScan_EmptyAdjacentRooms(t *testing.T) {
	// Set up an isolated room (no exits) and a UserActor in it.
	// Use the existing test scaffolding — see actions_test.go for the
	// makeTestRoom / makeTestUserActor helpers.
	room := makeTestRoom(t, 9001)
	user := makeTestUser(t, "TestScout")
	user.Character.RoomId = room.RoomId
	actor := &UserActor{User: user, Room: room}

	result := Scan(actor, ScanOptions{HostileOnly: false})

	if len(result.Sightings) != 0 {
		t.Errorf("expected 0 sightings, got %d", len(result.Sightings))
	}
}

// TestScan_MobActorSilent confirms MobActor.SendText is not called —
// the action returns structured data without emitting any text.
func TestScan_MobActorSilent(t *testing.T) {
	room := makeTestRoom(t, 9002)
	mob := makeTestMob(t, "TestScoutMob", room.RoomId)
	actor := NewMobActorInRoom(mob, room)

	// MobActor.SendText is a no-op by interface contract; verify the
	// action returns a populated result regardless.
	result := Scan(actor, ScanOptions{HostileOnly: true})

	// Empty room — just confirm the call doesn't panic and returns
	// a zero-valued result cleanly.
	if result.Sightings == nil {
		t.Error("Sightings should be empty slice, not nil")
	}
}
```

Note: the test references `makeTestRoom`, `makeTestUser`, `makeTestMob` helpers. Check `internal/actions/actions_test.go` for existing helpers; reuse if they exist, otherwise add to a new `testutil_test.go` (per existing convention). Adapt names to match.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test, verify it fails (Scan undefined)**

Run: `go test ./internal/actions/ -run TestScan -v`

Expected: build error or test failure with "Scan undefined" / "undefined: Scan".

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement actions/scan.go**

Create `internal/actions/scan.go`:

```go
package actions

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/messaging"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"

	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// ScanOptions parameterizes a one-step adjacent-room sweep.
type ScanOptions struct {
	// HostileOnly: when true, mob-actor SoftTarget population (via the
	// btree wrapper) gates on hostile-ness. The action itself does not
	// filter Sightings by hostility — that decision is up to the caller.
	HostileOnly bool
}

// ScanEntity describes one occupant in a sighted room.
type ScanEntity struct {
	Id    int
	Name  string
	IsMob bool

// ScanSighting describes one adjacent room's occupants.
type ScanSighting struct {
	ExitName  string

	Players   []ScanEntity
}

// ScanResult is the structured outcome.
type ScanResult struct {
	Sightings []ScanSighting
}

// Scan walks each visible (non-secret) exit, loads the adjacent room,
// and lists non-hidden mobs and players in each. No skill check, no
// cooldown. UserActor receives a rendered text list via SendText;
// MobActor SendText is a no-op (silent). The result is returned in
// both cases.
func Scan(actor Actor, opts ScanOptions) ScanResult {
	result := ScanResult{Sightings: []ScanSighting{}}

	room := actor.GetRoom()
	if room == nil {

	}

	// UserActor text rendering. MobActor.SendText is a no-op.
	if actor.IsPlayer() {
		actor.SendText(messaging.CategorySystem, `You scan the surrounding area...`)
		actor.SendText(messaging.CategorySystem, ``)
		if len(result.Sightings) == 0 {

			}
		}
		actor.SendText(messaging.CategorySystem, ``)
	}

	return result
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test, verify it passes**

Run: `go test ./internal/actions/ -run TestScan -v`

Expected: both `TestScan_EmptyAdjacentRooms` and `TestScan_MobActorSilent` PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the full actions package tests to confirm no regression**

Run: `go test ./internal/actions/...`

Expected: all tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

### Task 5: Lift Track into actions/track.go (TDD)

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/actions/track.go`
- Create: `internal/actions/track_test.go`

Track is the most complex of the three — it has trail-scan mode (no target), active-track mode (with target name or context source), buff application, and misc-data persistence. The existing player code is ~480 lines; the action will compress this to ~250 by sharing the trail-search and target-resolution logic between modes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `internal/actions/track_test.go`:

```go
package actions

import (
	"testing"
)

// TestTrack_NoArgEmptyRoom confirms trail-scan mode on a room with no
// visitors returns an empty Visitors slice.
func TestTrack_NoArgEmptyRoom(t *testing.T) {
	room := makeTestRoom(t, 9101)
	user := makeTestUser(t, "TrackTester")
	user.Character.RoomId = room.RoomId
	actor := &UserActor{User: user, Room: room}

	result := Track(actor, TrackOptions{})

	if len(result.Visitors) != 0 {
		t.Errorf("expected 0 visitors, got %d", len(result.Visitors))
	}
	if result.BuffApplied {
		t.Error("BuffApplied should be false on trail-scan mode")
	}
}

// TestTrack_ActiveTrackMobNoMatchFails confirms active-track mode with
// an unresolvable target sets Reason and does NOT apply buff 86.
func TestTrack_ActiveTrackMobNoMatchFails(t *testing.T) {
	room := makeTestRoom(t, 9102)
	user := makeTestUser(t, "TrackTester2")
	user.Character.RoomId = room.RoomId
	actor := &UserActor{User: user, Room: room}

	result := Track(actor, TrackOptions{TargetNoun: "nonexistent_target"})

	if result.BuffApplied {
		t.Error("BuffApplied should be false when target unresolved")
	}
	if result.ActiveTargetUserId != 0 || result.ActiveTargetMobInstId != 0 {
		t.Error("ActiveTarget* should be 0 when target unresolved")
	}
}

// TestTrack_MobActorSilent confirms MobActor.SendText is a no-op.
func TestTrack_MobActorSilent(t *testing.T) {
	room := makeTestRoom(t, 9103)
	mob := makeTestMob(t, "TrackMob", room.RoomId)
	actor := NewMobActorInRoom(mob, room)

	// Confirm no panic, result returned cleanly.
	_ = Track(actor, TrackOptions{})
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test, verify it fails**

Run: `go test ./internal/actions/ -run TestTrack -v`

Expected: build error or "Track undefined".

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement actions/track.go**

Create `internal/actions/track.go`:

### Task 6: Lift Search into actions/search.go (TDD)

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/actions/search.go`
- Create: `internal/actions/search_test.go`

// TestSearch_MobActorSilent confirms mob actor invocation works
// without panic.

	_ = Search(actor, SearchOptions{})
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test, verify it fails**

Run: `go test ./internal/actions/ -run TestSearch -v`

## Phase 3 — Thin player wrappers

### Task 7: Thin usercommands/scan.go

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/usercommands/scan.go` (full rewrite, ~25 LoC)

	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/events"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"

// Scan is a thin wrapper over actions.Scan. The action handles all
// rendering for player actors via SendText; this wrapper just
// constructs the actor + opts.
func Scan(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error) {
	actor := &actions.UserActor{User: user, Room: room}
	_ = actions.Scan(actor, actions.ScanOptions{HostileOnly: false})
	return true, nil
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build to confirm**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run usercommands tests to confirm no regressions**

Run: `go test ./internal/usercommands/...`

Expected: all tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/usercommands/scan.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(scan): thin player wrapper over actions.Scan (2.8)

```

### Task 8: Thin usercommands/skill.track.go

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/usercommands/skill.track.go` (full rewrite, ~30 LoC)

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite skill.track.go as wrapper**

Replace the entire contents of `internal/usercommands/skill.track.go` with:

```go
package usercommands

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/actions"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/events"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/questengine"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// Track is a thin wrapper over actions.Track. The action handles
// rendering, cooldowns, and buff application; this wrapper handles
// "stop"/"clear" keyword normalization and the quest-engine
// command notification.
func Track(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error) {
	opts := actions.TrackOptions{TargetNoun: rest}
	if rest == "stop" || rest == "clear" {
		opts = actions.TrackOptions{CancelTracking: true}
	}

	actor := &actions.UserActor{User: user, Room: room}
	_ = actions.Track(actor, opts)

	// Quest engine: command notification (preserved from prior behavior).
	bridge := questengine.NewGameBridge(user, room.RoomId)
	questengine.GetEngine().Notify("command", questengine.EventDetails{
		UserId:  user.UserId,
		RoomId:  room.RoomId,
		Command: "track",
	}, bridge, bridge)

	return true, nil
}
```

Drop all the helper types/funcs (`trackingInfo`, `trailStrengthToString`, `findExited`) — they're now in `actions/track.go`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build to confirm**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit. If the engineer's build complains about unused imports, prune them.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run usercommands tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/usercommands/ -run TestTrack -v`

Expected: existing TestTrack* tests pass (they may need touch-ups if they depended on the removed helper types — confirm during the failing-to-passing transition).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run all usercommands tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/usercommands/...`

Expected: all tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/usercommands/skill.track.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(track): thin player wrapper over actions.Track (2.8)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### Task 9: Thin usercommands/skill.search.go

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/usercommands/skill.search.go` (full rewrite, ~20 LoC)

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite skill.search.go as wrapper**

Replace the entire contents of `internal/usercommands/skill.search.go` with:

```go
package usercommands

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/actions"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/events"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// Search is a thin wrapper over actions.Search. The action handles
// all tier rolls, template rendering, cooldown gating, and skill
// progression.
func Search(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error) {
	actor := &actions.UserActor{User: user, Room: room}
	_ = actions.Search(actor, actions.SearchOptions{})
	return true, nil
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build to confirm**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run usercommands tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/usercommands/ -run TestSearch -v`

Expected: existing TestSearch* tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run all usercommands tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/usercommands/...`

Expected: all tests pass.

## Phase 4 — Mob wrappers

### Task 10: Add mob wrappers + register

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/mobcommands/scan.go`
- Create: `internal/mobcommands/track.go`
- Create: `internal/mobcommands/search.go`
- Modify: `internal/mobcommands/mobcommands.go` (add 3 entries to `mobCommands` map)

- [ ] **Step 1: Create mobcommands/scan.go**

```go
package mobcommands

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/actions"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
)

func Scan(rest string, mob *mobs.Mob, room *rooms.Room) (bool, error) {
	actor := actions.NewMobActorInRoom(mob, room)
	_ = actions.Scan(actor, actions.ScanOptions{HostileOnly: false})
	return true, nil
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create mobcommands/track.go**

```go
package mobcommands

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/actions"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
)

func Track(rest string, mob *mobs.Mob, room *rooms.Room) (bool, error) {
	opts := actions.TrackOptions{TargetNoun: rest}
	if rest == "stop" || rest == "clear" {
		opts = actions.TrackOptions{CancelTracking: true}
	}
	actor := actions.NewMobActorInRoom(mob, room)
	_ = actions.Track(actor, opts)
	return true, nil
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Create mobcommands/search.go**

```go
package mobcommands

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/actions"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
)

func Search(rest string, mob *mobs.Mob, room *rooms.Room) (bool, error) {
	actor := actions.NewMobActorInRoom(mob, room)
	_ = actions.Search(actor, actions.SearchOptions{})
	return true, nil
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Register in mobcommands.go**

Edit `internal/mobcommands/mobcommands.go`. Find the alphabetically-appropriate insertion points in the `mobCommands` map and add three entries:

```go
		"scan":           {Scan, false},
```

(insert between `salvage` and `say`)

```go
		"search":         {Search, false},
```

(insert between `say` and `selljunk` — no, actually between `say` and `sayto`... preserve alphabetical order)

```go
		"track":          {Track, false},
```

(insert between `taunt` and `trip` — confirm alphabetical position)

Use Edit tool. Verify final ordering matches existing alphabetical layout.

- [ ] **Step 5: Build**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run mobcommands tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/mobcommands/...`

Expected: all tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/mobcommands/scan.go internal/mobcommands/track.go internal/mobcommands/search.go internal/mobcommands/mobcommands.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(mobcommands): add scan/track/search wrappers (2.8)

Thin wrappers over actions.{Scan,Track,Search}. Registered in
the mobCommands map. Mob actors are silent (SendText no-op);
btree consumers read the structured action results.

**Note on `dispatchMobCommand`:** the placeholder above is INTENTIONALLY a stub. During implementation, grep `internal/behaviortree/` for `events.Input{MobInstanceId` or `events.AddToQueue` calls that fire mob commands. The `command` btree action (`actCommand`) is the canonical example — copy that pattern. Replace the stub before committing this task.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create conditions_scout.go**

```go
package behaviortree

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/rooms"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// condRoomHasHiddenEntity returns Success when at least one hidden mob
// or hidden player is in the room. Cheap pre-check for archetypes
// before paying for try_search's cooldown + per-discovery rolls.
func condRoomHasHiddenEntity(params map[string]any, ctx *EvalContext) Result {
	mob := mobs.GetInstance(ctx.InstanceId)

	if room == nil {
		return Failure

// (Active Tracking).

	if mob == nil {
		return Failure
	}
	if mob.Character.HasBuff(86) {
		return Success
	}
	return Failure
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Resolve the dispatchMobCommand placeholder**

Search for the canonical mob-command dispatch pattern:

```bash
# Inside Grep tool:
pattern: "events\.Input\{MobInstanceId|actCommand"
path: "internal/behaviortree"
output_mode: "content"
-n: true
```

Open the matched function (likely `actCommand` in `actions.go`). Copy the dispatch shape into `dispatchMobCommand` in `actions_scout.go`. Replace the `return true // PLACEHOLDER` line.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build to confirm**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run behaviortree package tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/behaviortree/...`

Expected: existing tests pass (no new tests added — primitives validated by smoke per the spec's testing section).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/behaviortree/actions_scout.go internal/behaviortree/conditions_scout.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(behaviortree): add scout primitives (2.8)

Adds try_scan, try_track, try_search, move_toward_tracked actions

```

### Task 12: Register btree primitives in init()

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/behaviortree/actions.go` (add 4 entries to actionRegistry in init())
- Modify: `internal/behaviortree/conditions.go` (add 2 entries to conditionRegistry in init())

- [ ] **Step 1: Register actions**

In `internal/behaviortree/actions.go`, locate the `init()` function and add at the end (after the existing registrations):

```go
	// Scout / track / scan (2.8)
	actionRegistry["try_scan"] = actTryScan
	actionRegistry["try_track"] = actTryTrack
	actionRegistry["try_search"] = actTrySearch
	actionRegistry["move_toward_tracked"] = actMoveTowardTracked
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Register conditions**

In `internal/behaviortree/conditions.go`, locate the `init()` function and add at the end:

```go
	// Scout / track / scan (2.8)
	conditionRegistry["room_has_hidden_entity"] = condRoomHasHiddenEntity
	conditionRegistry["mob_is_tracking"] = condMobIsTracking
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Build**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run behaviortree tests**

Run: `go test ./internal/behaviortree/...`

Expected: all tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/behaviortree/actions.go internal/behaviortree/conditions.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

```

Verify the `has_aggro` condition exists during implementation; if not, grep for the closest analog or use a different gate (e.g., `mob_combat_target_set`).

- [ ] **Step 2: Flip goblin_scout to scout archetype**

Edit `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/ironwind_steppe/217-goblin_scout.yaml`. Find the `behavior_archetype: lookout` line and replace with:

```yaml
behavior_archetype: scout
```

Verify the mob has at least skill rank 1 in `search`. If absent, add (or bump) under the `skills:` section. Otherwise the `Track`/`Search` skill rolls will fall back to base Perception.

- [ ] **Step 3: Boot the server, confirm archetype loads + mob spawns**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -150`

Expected: clean boot past `behaviors.LoadDataFiles()` and `mobs.LoadDataFiles()`. No panics. Kill the server.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/scout.yaml _datafiles/world/dogmud/mobs/ironwind_steppe/217-goblin_scout.yaml

### Task 14: Graft scan-before-ambush onto lookout.yaml

**Files:**
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/lookout.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the scan-before-ambush branch**

Edit `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/lookout.yaml`. Insert a new branch between the panic-flee branch (mob_hurt + health-below) and the existing `player_enter` ambush branch:

```yaml
    # NEW (chunk 2.8): early-warning scan on idle. If a hostile is
    # sighted in an adjacent room, set SoftTarget and call for help
    # before they walk in.
    - type: sequence
      event: mob_idle
      children:
        - type: action
          do: try_scan
          hostile_only: true
        - type: action
          do: command
          cmd: callforhelp
```

Position: insert immediately AFTER the closing of the panic-flee `mob_hurt` branch and BEFORE the existing `player_enter` ambush branch.

- [ ] **Step 2: Boot, confirm clean load**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -150`

Expected: clean boot. Kill the server.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/lookout.yaml

### Task 15: Graft search-before-steal onto thief.yaml

**Files:**
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/thief.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the search-before-steal branch**

Edit `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/thief.yaml`. Insert a new branch immediately BEFORE the existing branch 4 ("Core loop: idle + hidden + gold-bearing player..."):

```yaml
    # NEW (chunk 2.8): catch hidden rivals or hidden players before
    # stealing. If a hidden hostile is present, abandon stealth long
    # enough to alert.
    - type: sequence
      event: mob_idle
      children:
        - type: condition
          check: room_has_hidden_entity
        - type: action
          do: try_search
        - type: action
          do: command
          cmd: callforhelp
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Boot, confirm clean load**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -150`

Expected: clean boot. Kill the server.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```

### Task 16: Graft track-on-aggro-lost onto leader.yaml

**Files:**
- Modify: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/leader.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the track-on-aggro-lost branch**

Edit `_datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/leader.yaml`. Append a new `mob_idle` branch AFTER the existing branches:

```yaml
    # NEW (chunk 2.8): chase a fleeing aggro target across rooms.
    # try_track applies buff 86 + stores misc data; move_toward_tracked
    # walks the freshest direction each tick.
    - type: sequence
      event: mob_idle
      children:
        - type: condition
          check: has_aggro
        - type: action
          do: try_track
          target_from: aggro

    - type: sequence
      event: mob_idle
      children:
        - type: condition
          check: mob_is_tracking
        - type: action
          do: move_toward_tracked
```

Note: this adds TWO branches — one for "I have aggro but target isn't in the room → start tracking" and one for "I'm already tracking → keep moving." If a `has_aggro` condition doesn't exist, the engineer should either add it (similar to the scout's branch 3) or use the closest existing analog. Confirm during impl.

- [ ] **Step 2: Boot, confirm clean load**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -150`

Expected: clean boot. Kill the server.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/behaviors/archetypes/leader.yaml
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Phase 7 — Shadow parity + universal cleanup hooks

These four tasks fold the buff-87 (Shadowing) sister mechanic into the same cleanup contract as buff 86, then add universal death/logoff cleanup hooks that drop both buffs and clear both misc-data namespaces when the target ceases to exist.

### Task 17: Author `87-shadowing.yaml`

**Files:**
- Create: `_datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/87-shadowing.yaml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the buff YAML**

Write `_datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/87-shadowing.yaml` with this content:

```yaml
buffid: 87
name: Shadowing
description: You are stalking a quarry from the shadows, matching their every step.
triggerrate: 1 round
triggercount: 25
start_user_text: You fall into your quarry's wake, footfalls silenced to match theirs.
end_user_text: Your quarry slips from view; your focus breaks.
```

No statmods, no flags. Same duration as buff 86 (25 rounds).

- [ ] **Step 2: Boot the server, confirm load**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -120`

Expected: `buffs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=71` (was 70 after Task 1). No panics. Kill the server.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add _datafiles/world/dogmud/buffs/87-shadowing.yaml
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(buffs): add 87 Shadowing (sister buff to 86 Active Tracking)

Adds a 25-round duration token for the shadow mechanic. Previously
shadow had no auto-expiry — only manual stop + losing the hidden
buff cleared it. Sets up Task 18's audit + cleanup-on-buff-absence
contract.

EOF
)"
```

### Task 18: Audit + amend shadow.go for buff 87 lifecycle

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/actions/shadow.go` (apply buff 87 on success)
- Modify: `internal/usercommands/skill.skullduggery.shadow.go` (endShadow cleanup)
- Modify: `internal/usercommands/go.go:381` (auto-follow consumer — gate on buff 87)

**Context:** Shadow today has no auto-expiry. The auto-follow logic in `go.go:381` reads shadow-target-* misc data and auto-moves shadowers when a target moves. With buff 87 in place, that consumer should also enforce the cleanup contract: misc data without buff = stale = clear it and skip.

- [ ] **Step 1: Apply buff 87 on Shadow success — `actions/shadow.go`**

In `shadowMob()` (around line 82), after the misc-data SetMiscData calls and before the success message, add:

```go
actor.AddBuff(87, "skill")
```

In `shadowPlayer()` (around line 130), apply the same addition at the equivalent spot (after SetMiscData, before the success message). Note: `shadowPlayer` performs the detection roll AFTER setting state today; place the AddBuff call alongside the SetMiscData calls so the buff is set whether or not detection fires.

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove buff 87 in endShadow — `skill.skullduggery.shadow.go`**

Edit `endShadow()` (around line 90). After the two SetMiscData(nil) calls and before the cooldown set, add:

```go
user.Character.RemoveBuff(87)
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Gate the auto-follow consumer on buff 87**

Open `internal/usercommands/go.go` and find the shadowing block around line 381 (the comment says "shadowing the mover (user)"). Wrap the existing auto-move logic with a `HasBuff(87)` gate. When misc data is set but buff is absent, clear misc data and skip:

**Before** (paraphrased structure — confirm exact shape during implementation):
```go
if shadowIsTargetingUser(shadower, moverUserId) {
    // ... auto-move logic ...
}
```

**After:**
```go
if shadowIsTargetingUser(shadower, moverUserId) {
    if !shadower.Character.HasBuff(87) {
        // Buff absent — clear stale shadow state and skip.
        shadower.Character.SetMiscData("shadow-target-user", nil)
        shadower.Character.SetMiscData("shadow-target-mob", nil)
        // skip the auto-move
    } else {
        // ... existing auto-move logic unchanged ...
    }
}
```

If there's a sibling block for the mob-target shadow path in the same file, apply the same gating.

- [ ] **Step 4: Find and gate any other shadow consumers**

Run: Grep tool with pattern `shadow-target-user|shadow-target-mob` in path `internal`, output_mode `content`, `-n: true`.

Expected matches: `actions/shadow.go`, `usercommands/skill.skullduggery.shadow.go`, `usercommands/go.go`, `actions/shadow_test.go`. If any other consumer reads these keys without buff gating (excluding test files), apply the same fix.

- [ ] **Step 5: Build + test**

Run: `go build ./... && go test ./internal/actions/... ./internal/usercommands/...`

Expected: clean exit. The existing shadow tests in `actions/shadow_test.go` should still pass (buff application is additive, doesn't change success criteria). If a test asserts no buff is applied, update it to assert buff 87 IS applied.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/actions/shadow.go internal/usercommands/skill.skullduggery.shadow.go internal/usercommands/go.go internal/actions/shadow_test.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(shadow): apply buff 87 lifecycle + gate auto-follow consumer

Shadow now applies buff 87 on success (matching track's buff 86
pattern). endShadow removes buff 87. The auto-follow consumer in
go.go gates on HasBuff(87) — stale misc data without a live buff
is cleared and skipped, preventing phantom shadows from dragging
players to dead/logged-off targets.

### Task 19: Add MobDeath_TrackingCleanup hook

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/hooks/MobDeath_TrackingCleanup.go`
- Modify: `internal/hooks/hooks.go` (register the new listener — confirm registration pattern from existing MobDeath_* hooks)

- [ ] **Step 1: Find the existing registration pattern**

Open `internal/hooks/hooks.go` and locate where existing `MobDeath_*` hooks are registered (e.g., `MobDeathFactionRep`, `MobDeathBountyClaim`). The pattern is likely a call to `events.RegisterListener(events.MobDeath, ...)` or similar. Copy the surrounding lines so the new hook can be added in the same style.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create MobDeath_TrackingCleanup.go**

```go
package hooks

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/events"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// MobDeathTrackingCleanup clears tracking/shadow state on any character
// (player or mob) that was tracking or shadowing the now-dead mob. Pairs
// with PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup for the symmetric logoff path.
//
// State cleared per pointing character:
//   - tracking-mob misc (string match on mob name)
//   - shadow-target-mob misc (int match on InstanceId)
//   - buff 86 (Active Tracking) — only if tracking-* state was on this mob
//   - buff 87 (Shadowing) — only if shadow-target-* state was on this mob
func MobDeathTrackingCleanup(e events.Event) events.ListenerReturn {
	evt, ok := e.(events.MobDeath)
	if !ok {
		return events.Continue
	}

	// The mob instance is destroyed by the time this fires for some
	// downstream listeners; resolve the dying mob's name + InstanceId
	// from the event payload. evt.MobInstanceId is always set. For the
	// name we need to fetch the template if the instance is gone.
	dyingInstanceId := evt.MobInstanceId
	dyingName := ""
	if m := mobs.GetInstance(dyingInstanceId); m != nil {
		dyingName = m.Character.Name
	} else if tmpl := mobs.GetMobSpec(evt.MobId); tmpl != nil {
		dyingName = tmpl.Character.Name
	}

	clearPointersTo := func(getMisc func(string) any, setMisc func(string, any), removeBuff func(int)) {
		// Tracking by name.
		if dyingName != "" {
			if v := getMisc("tracking-mob"); v != nil {
				if s, ok := v.(string); ok && s == dyingName {
					setMisc("tracking-mob", nil)
					setMisc("tracking-display-count", nil)
					removeBuff(86)
				}
			}
		}
		// Shadow by InstanceId.
		if v := getMisc("shadow-target-mob"); v != nil {
			if id, ok := v.(int); ok && id == dyingInstanceId {
				setMisc("shadow-target-mob", nil)
				removeBuff(87)
			}
		}
	}

	// Walk all online users.
	for _, u := range users.GetAllActiveUsers() {
		if u == nil {
			continue
		}
		c := &u.Character
		clearPointersTo(c.GetMiscData, c.SetMiscData, c.RemoveBuff)
	}

	// Walk all active mob instances.
	for _, m := range mobs.GetAllMobInstances() {
		if m == nil || m.InstanceId == dyingInstanceId {
			continue
		}
		c := &m.Character
		clearPointersTo(c.GetMiscData, c.SetMiscData, c.RemoveBuff)
	}

	return events.Continue
}
```

**Note on `users.GetAllActiveUsers()` / `mobs.GetAllMobInstances()`:** these helper names may differ in the actual codebase. During implementation, grep for the existing iteration patterns (e.g., what does `MobDeath_FactionRep.go` use to walk damager users? what walks all mobs in similar contexts?). Common candidates: `users.GetOnlineUserIds()`, `mobs.GetAllMobs()`, or similar. Use whatever is canonical.

**Note on `mobs.GetMobSpec`:** confirm the function name for fetching a template by MobId. Likely candidates: `mobs.GetMobSpec`, `mobs.GetTemplate`, or similar.

- [ ] **Step 3: Register the listener in hooks.go**

Following the pattern found in Step 1, add a registration line. Likely shape:

```go
events.RegisterListener(events.MobDeath{}, MobDeathTrackingCleanup)
```

Place it alphabetically or alongside the other `MobDeath*` registrations.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit. If function names from the notes above are wrong, the build will surface them — fix and re-run.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/hooks/MobDeath_TrackingCleanup.go internal/hooks/hooks.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(hooks): clear tracking/shadow state on mob death

When a mob dies, walk all online users + active mob instances and
clear tracking-mob (by name) or shadow-target-mob (by InstanceId)
on any character pointing to the dying mob. Also removes buff 86
or buff 87 from those characters. Symmetric with the player-logoff
hook in Task 20.

```

### Task 20: Add PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup hook

**Files:**
- Create: `internal/hooks/PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup.go`
- Modify: `internal/hooks/hooks.go` (register the new listener)

This task could alternatively augment `HandleLeave` in `PlayerDespawn_HandleLeave.go` rather than creating a new file. Standalone file is cleaner — `HandleLeave` is already doing a lot of work and tracking-cleanup is orthogonal to its concerns.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup.go**

```go
package hooks

import (
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/events"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/mobs"
	"github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/internal/users"
)

// PlayerDespawnTrackingCleanup clears tracking/shadow state on any
// character (player or mob) that was tracking or shadowing the now-
// despawning player. Pairs with MobDeath_TrackingCleanup for the
// symmetric mob-death path.
//
// State cleared per pointing character:
//   - tracking-user misc (string match on user name)
//   - shadow-target-user misc (int match on UserId)
//   - buff 86 (Active Tracking) — only if tracking-* state was on this user
//   - buff 87 (Shadowing) — only if shadow-target-* state was on this user
func PlayerDespawnTrackingCleanup(e events.Event) events.ListenerReturn {
	evt, ok := e.(events.PlayerDespawn)
	if !ok {
		return events.Continue
	}

	leavingUser := users.GetByUserId(evt.UserId)
	if leavingUser == nil {
		return events.Continue
	}
	leavingName := leavingUser.Character.Name
	leavingUserId := leavingUser.UserId

	clearPointersTo := func(getMisc func(string) any, setMisc func(string, any), removeBuff func(int)) {
		// Tracking by name.
		if v := getMisc("tracking-user"); v != nil {
			if s, ok := v.(string); ok && s == leavingName {
				setMisc("tracking-user", nil)
				setMisc("tracking-display-count", nil)
				removeBuff(86)
			}
		}
		// Shadow by UserId.
		if v := getMisc("shadow-target-user"); v != nil {
			if id, ok := v.(int); ok && id == leavingUserId {
				setMisc("shadow-target-user", nil)
				removeBuff(87)
			}
		}
	}

	// Walk all other online users.
	for _, u := range users.GetAllActiveUsers() {
		if u == nil || u.UserId == leavingUserId {
			continue
		}
		c := &u.Character
		clearPointersTo(c.GetMiscData, c.SetMiscData, c.RemoveBuff)
	}

	// Walk all active mob instances.
	for _, m := range mobs.GetAllMobInstances() {
		if m == nil {
			continue
		}
		c := &m.Character
		clearPointersTo(c.GetMiscData, c.SetMiscData, c.RemoveBuff)
	}

	return events.Continue
}
```

Same caveats on helper-function names as Task 19 — confirm during implementation.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the listener in hooks.go**

Find the registration line for `HandleLeave` (the existing PlayerDespawn listener) and register the new one alongside:

```go
events.RegisterListener(events.PlayerDespawn{}, PlayerDespawnTrackingCleanup)
```

Order matters slightly — register AFTER `HandleLeave` so HandleLeave's user lookups still see the leaving user in `users.GetByUserId` (this hook uses GetByUserId BEFORE the user is fully removed; HandleLeave is the one that calls `users.LogOutUserByConnectionId`). If event ordering proves brittle, refactor to inline the cleanup into HandleLeave before the LogOutUser call.

- [ ] **Step 3: Build**

Run: `go build ./...`

Expected: clean exit.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/hooks/PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup.go internal/hooks/hooks.go
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(hooks): clear tracking/shadow state on player despawn

When a player logs off (or otherwise despawns), walk all other
online users + active mob instances and clear tracking-user (by
name) or shadow-target-user (by UserId) on any character pointing
to the leaving user. Also removes buff 86 or buff 87. Symmetric
with MobDeath_TrackingCleanup.

## Phase 8 — Docs + smoke + roadmap

### Task 21: Update context.md files

**Files:**
- Modify: `internal/behaviortree/context.md`
- Modify: `internal/actions/context.md`
- Modify: `internal/hooks/context.md` (add the two new cleanup hooks)

- [ ] **Step 1: Update behaviortree/context.md**

Open `internal/behaviortree/context.md`. Find the section listing registered actions and add entries for the four new primitives + two conditions:

- `try_scan` — invokes actions.Scan; on hostile sighting, sets ctx.SoftTarget; returns Success on any sighting (Failure when HostileOnly and no hostile found)
- `try_track` — invokes actions.Track with target_from source; applies buff 86 on adjacent-trail hit; seeds ctx.SoftTarget
- `try_search` — invokes actions.Search; promotes first hidden hostile to ctx.SoftTarget; ignores Tier-1/Tier-3 hits
- `move_toward_tracked` — reads buff 86 + tracking-{user,mob} misc data; dispatches `go <direction>`
- `room_has_hidden_entity` (condition) — true when room contains a hidden mob or hidden player
- `mob_is_tracking` (condition) — true when self mob carries buff 86

Match the existing context.md formatting (alphabetical insertion, brief one-line descriptions).

- [ ] **Step 2: Update actions/context.md**

Open `internal/actions/context.md`. Add entries for the three new actions in the same shape as existing entries (Consider, Sneak, Steal, etc.):

- `Scan(actor, opts) ScanResult` — adjacent-room sweep; UserActor emits rendered list, MobActor silent
- `Track(actor, opts) TrackResult` — trail-read (no-arg) or active-track (TargetNoun); applies buff 86 + misc data on active-track success
- `Search(actor, opts) SearchResult` — three-tier discovery (exits, stashed/hidden, nouns); 2-round cooldown

Update the `Shadow` entry to note that it now applies buff 87 on success and that the auto-follow consumer in `usercommands/go.go` gates on `HasBuff(87)`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update hooks/context.md**

Open `internal/hooks/context.md`. Add brief entries (alphabetical insertion):

- `MobDeath_TrackingCleanup` — clears `tracking-mob`/`shadow-target-mob` misc + buff 86/87 from all characters pointing to the dying mob
- `PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup` — clears `tracking-user`/`shadow-target-user` misc + buff 86/87 from all characters pointing to the leaving user

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add internal/behaviortree/context.md internal/actions/context.md internal/hooks/context.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(2.8): update context.md for scout primitives, lifted actions, and cleanup hooks

)"
```

### Task 22: Boot + smoke + mark roadmap done

**Files:**
- Modify: `MOB_ALIVENESS_ROADMAP.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Final clean build + full test suite**

Run: `go build ./... && go test ./...`

Expected: clean exit, all tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 2: Boot the server cleanly**

Run: `go run . 2>&1 | head -200`

Expected: clean boot past all `LoadDataFiles()` calls including:
- `buffs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=70` (was 69 before buff 86)
- `behaviors.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=<unchanged + 1>` (scout.yaml added)
- `mobs.LoadDataFiles() loadedCount=<unchanged>` (goblin_scout flip)

Kill the server.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the smoke test plan from the spec**

The smoke test plan is documented in section "Smoke test plan" of `docs/superpowers/specs/completed/2026-05-22-mob-aliveness-2.8-scout-track-scan-design.md`. Run all scenarios PLUS the regression-check scenario for the previously-reported "tracking forever" bug:

1. Scout idle-scan loop (goblin_scout 217)
2. Scout-room search (sneak into goblin_scout's room)
3. Lookout scan-before-ambush (bandit_lookout 283)
4. Thief search-before-steal (thornwall_highwayman 90)
5. Leader track-on-aggro-lost (any leader-archetype mob, e.g., bandit chief)
6. Active-tracking buff observability (verify buff 86 applies on mob)

7. **Regression check — tracking auto-expires after 25 rounds.** As a player, `track <some_name_with_trail>` and confirm the buff applies (`buffs` command) and the tracking direction renders in subsequent room views. Wait out the 25-round buff duration (or use admin tooling to fast-expire). Confirm:
   - The buff-end text "The trail grows cold; your focus slips." fires.
   - The next room view shows NO tracking-direction line.
   - The misc data is cleared (admin `inspect player` or equivalent — verify `tracking-mob` / `tracking-user` keys are absent or nil).

8. **Regression check — tracking ends when target found.** As a player, `track <target>` toward someone, then walk to their room. Confirm the "they are here!" message fires once, the buff is removed, and subsequent room views do NOT re-render tracking direction.

9. **Escape gate — tracked mob dies.** As a player, `track <mob_name>` on a nearby low-HP mob. Then kill the mob (combat or admin slay). Confirm immediately after death:
   - Buff 86 is removed.
   - `tracking-mob` misc is cleared.
   - Subsequent room views show no zombie tracking line.

10. **Escape gate — tracked player logs off.** Have a second test player walk through some rooms (laying a trail) then log off. Active-track them from a different character. Confirm immediately after the logoff:
    - Buff 86 is removed.
    - `tracking-user` misc is cleared.

11. **Escape gate — shadowed mob dies.** Sneak (buff 9) near a low-HP mob, `shadow <mob>`. Confirm buff 87 applied. Kill the mob. Confirm:
    - Buff 87 is removed.
    - `shadow-target-mob` misc is cleared.
    - The auto-follow consumer does not fire on the next room transition.

12. **Escape gate — shadowed player logs off.** Sneak, `shadow <test_player>`, have the test player log off. Confirm buff 87 + `shadow-target-user` are cleared. Move the shadower one room over and confirm no phantom auto-follow.

13. **Shadow basic smoke.** Audit pass — sneak, shadow a moving NPC across 3+ rooms, confirm the shadower auto-moves with the target. Use admin `inspect` to confirm buff 87 stays alive throughout. Wait out the 25-round expiry and confirm the buff naturally ends with cleanup.

Document results in a smoke report:
`tools/testing/reports/2026-05-22-local-feature-tester-chunk-2.8-scout.md`

If any scenario fails, fix the underlying issue (separate commit) before proceeding. If a scenario fails due to a hand-off discovery (faction-rep ergonomics, `has_aggro` absence, `mob_target_lost` event absence), surface to the user before working around — per the spec's commitment.

- [ ] **Step 4: Kill all test mud servers**

Per the standing SOP (`feedback_kill_test_servers.md`).

Run: `tasklist | findstr -i "dogmud go" 2>&1` then `taskkill /F /PID <pid>` for each match. Or `Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*dogmud*" -or $_.Name -eq "go"}` then `Stop-Process` in PowerShell.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update MOB_ALIVENESS_ROADMAP.md**

Edit `MOB_ALIVENESS_ROADMAP.md`:

1. **Progress tracker row** — change `| 2.8 | Tactical | Mob scout / track / scan | S | — | Not started |` to `| 2.8 | Tactical | Mob scout / track / scan | M | — | Done |` (note S → M size update reflecting the scope expansion).

2. **Roll-up line** — change `**Roll-up:** 15 / 41 done • 0 in progress • 26 not started.` to `**Roll-up:** 16 / 41 done • 0 in progress • 25 not started.`.

3. **Chunk 2.8 mini-brief** — change `**Status:** Not started • **Size:** S` to `**Status:** Done (2026-05-22) • **Size:** M (originally scoped S; expanded during plan-writing)` and append a `**Shipped:**` bullet capturing:
   - Three actions lifted into `internal/actions/` (`Scan`, `Track`, `Search`).
   - Four btree action primitives (`try_scan`, `try_track`, `try_search`, `move_toward_tracked`) + two conditions (`room_has_hidden_entity`, `mob_is_tracking`).
   - New `scout` archetype + flip on goblin_scout (217).
   - Single-branch grafts onto `lookout` (scan-before-ambush), `thief` (search-before-steal), `leader` (track-on-aggro-lost).
   - **Bundled bug fix #1:** authored buff 86 (Active Tracking, 25-round duration) replacing buff 26 (Conviction Surge) misuse in skill.track.go. Migrated 4 AddBuff + 5 RemoveBuff call sites. Fixed the "tracking forever" bug by adding a `HasBuff(86)` outer gate at the roomdetails.go renderer that clears misc data on buff absence.
   - **Bundled bug fix #2:** authored buff 87 (Shadowing, 25-round duration). Shadow now applies buff 87 on success and the auto-follow consumer in go.go gates on buff presence, preventing phantom shadows from dragging players to dead/logged-off targets.
   - **Universal escape gates:** new hooks `MobDeath_TrackingCleanup` and `PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup` clear tracking/shadow misc data + buffs 86/87 on any character pointing to the dying mob / leaving user.
   - Spec + plan paths.

- [ ] **Step 6: Final commit**

```bash
git add MOB_ALIVENESS_ROADMAP.md tools/testing/reports/2026-05-22-local-feature-tester-chunk-2.8-scout.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(2.8): mark mob-aliveness 2.8 Done

Roll-up: 16 / 41 done. Adds scout/track/scan verbs + new scout
archetype + lookout/thief/leader grafts. Bundles buff-26

## Self-review checklist (for the implementing engineer)

After all 22 tasks land, before declaring 2.8 done:

- [ ] All three actions registered via the actor pattern (`internal/actions/{scan,track,search}.go`).
- [ ] Buff 86 authored (25-round duration); 4 AddBuff + 5 RemoveBuff calls migrated.
- [ ] Buff 87 authored (25-round duration); shadow path applies + removes it.
- [ ] Player wrappers thinned (~25 LoC each).
- [ ] Mob wrappers added and registered.
- [ ] Four btree actions + two conditions registered in init().
- [ ] `scout.yaml` archetype authored; goblin_scout (217) flipped.
- [ ] Three grafts applied (lookout/thief/leader).
- [ ] Shadow auto-follow consumer in `go.go` gates on `HasBuff(87)`.
- [ ] `MobDeath_TrackingCleanup` + `PlayerDespawn_TrackingCleanup` hooks registered.
- [ ] context.md files updated (behaviortree, actions, hooks).
- [ ] Smoke plan run end-to-end (all 13 scenarios) with results documented.
- [ ] Roadmap row + roll-up + mini-brief all updated; size noted as S → M.
- [ ] `go build ./...` clean.
- [ ] `go test ./...` clean.
- [ ] Server boots cleanly past all `LoadDataFiles()` calls (loadedCount=71 buffs after both new buffs land).
- [ ] No remaining `AddBuff(26)` / `RemoveBuff(26)` references in non-Conviction-Surge code.
