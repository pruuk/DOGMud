# New Plymouth — City-Wide Design Layer (Design Spec)

*Date: 2026-06-20 · The shared skeleton every district build pulls from.*

> **What this is.** The city-wide design layer called for by the New Plymouth
> master plan (`docs/superpowers/specs/completed/2026-06-20-new-plymouth-design.md` §7-C):
> the **coordinate/zone geometry**, the **6 faction definitions**, the **civic
> infrastructure**, the **Docks-warehouse supply map**, and a **~45-anchor
> roster sketch** with its cross-district relationship + supply web. It is
> designed resident-first: rooms and streets exist because residents need them.
>
> **Scope:** structural skeleton + roster *sketch* (one line per anchor). Full
> anchor life-sheets (schedules, dialogue), the ~80 ambient/transient templates,
> and exact per-room coordinates are authored **per district at build time**,
> pulling from this layer. Canon bible: `docs/new_plymouth_canon.md`.
> Build order: districts **Docks-first** (§8).

## 1. The organizing principle (restated)

The city is a **population, not a floorplan**. Geometry is shaped by how people
live and move — daily routines (home → work → meals → pub → sleep) that cross
districts, supply that flows, civic hearts where routines intersect. Two
arteries carry the city's life and cross at its heart; neighborhoods hang off
them; civic infrastructure sits *on* them where lives converge. Every primitive
this needs already ships (aliveness roadmap 45/45: schedules, sleep, patrols,
NPC↔NPC conversation, relationships, factions, goals, market participation).

---

## 2. Geometry — arteries first, neighborhoods hung on them

North of the existing outskirts (`y > 78`). Canon-oriented: Docks west on the
water, Temple east on the ridge, Noble/Palace the northern climb, Merchant the
central hub.

```

```

### The two arteries (first-class design objects; district builds must honor)

- **The Long Market (E–W spine):** Docks → Crafting → **Central Square** →
  Temple. The working/commerce axis **and the mini-caravan supply route** (§5).
  Goods land at the Docks and flow east to every vendor; NPCs commute along it.
- **The Processional (N–S spine):** East Gate → Common → **Central Square** →
  Noble → Palace. The civic/ceremonial axis — the gate-to-palace climb.
- They **cross at the Central Square** (Merchant) — the great market, the one
  room everyone passes through. That crossing is *why* Merchant is the hub.

### Zone regions (non-overlapping; exact per-room coords assigned + `cartcheck`-validated per build)

| Zone | Folder | x-range | y-range | z | Rooms | Role in the living city |
|------|--------|---------|---------|---|-------|--------------------------|
| Docks | `new_plymouth_docks` | −42 … −22 | 82 … 102 | 0 | 30 | import origin; dock community; rough lodging |
| Common | `new_plymouth_common` | −20 … −2 | 80 … 98 | 0 | 25 | **most homes**; the working populace; gate entry |
| Crafting | `new_plymouth_crafting` | −24 … −8 | 100 … 114 | 0 | 25 | artisan workplaces; the Inkwalk; cooperage traces |
| Merchant | `new_plymouth_merchant` | −8 … +8 | 100 … 116 | 0 | 25 | the heart; great market; banks; Horst's base |
| Temple | `new_plymouth_temple` | +8 … +24 | 100 … 116 | 0 | 25 | faith; respawn; Archive; pilgrim arrival |
| Noble | `new_plymouth_noble` | −8 … +10 | 116 … 130 | 0 | 20 | elite homes; bloodline admin; the watched streets |
| Old Quarter | `new_plymouth_oldquarter` | −28 … −8 | 86 … 102 | −1 | 20 | buried canal city; Bloom basement; pre-Founding lore |

**ID blocks** (from the master plan, verified clear): rooms 5500–6199 (100/zone);
mobs 9300–9499; items 40100–40299; quests 63–90; dialogue 9209–9399; buffs 90–95.

### Connections

- **River Road (5480)** → new north exit → runs west along the waterfront into
  the **Docks** (the discreet/ford route, per canon).
- **East Gate (5471)** → new north exit → gate plaza into the **Common Quarter**
  (the watched overland entry).
- Districts tile north along the arteries; **Old Quarter (z=−1)** has stair
  access from Docks, Common, and the cooperage (Crafting).
- The exact gate-transition rooms are resolved in the Docks/Common builds.
- **Update `docs/coordinate_map.md`** as each district lands (it is currently
  stale — predates the whole corridor).

---

## 3. Factions (the substrate of daily disposition)

Six new faction slugs. Membership colors each anchor's trust, gossip, drinking
company, and resentments. Definition YAMLs at
`_datafiles/world/dogmud/factions/{slug}.yaml`.

| Slug | Who | Default rep (outsiders) | Allies | Enemies |
|------|-----|--------------------------|--------|---------|
| `bloodline_domestic` | Horst, agents, clerks, Noble admin, palace guard, the Archive gate | −10 | `temple_np` (institutional) | `cooperage_circle` |
| `cooperage_circle` | departed dissidents; remaining sympathizers (cooper's lad, glassblower, bookseller, gallery keeper, doubting novice) | +5 | — | `bloodline_domestic` |
| `bloom_trade` | Deren, Cade's successor, dock/canal contacts — hidden criminal | −20 (when known) | — | (wary: dockfolk, commonfolk) |
| `temple_np` | Yelin, Thane, canons, healers, scholars | 0 | `bloodline_domestic` (institutional, not all members) | — |
| `np_dockfolk` | dock community: foreman, keepers, warehouse, runner, pawnbroker | +10 | `np_commonfolk` | — |
| `np_commonfolk` | the Common populace; servants working up in Noble | +10 | `np_dockfolk` | — |

**Living-city note:** the bloodline's reach is *felt* daily — gate checkpoints,
tribute, the watched Noble streets — so `np_dockfolk`/`np_commonfolk` carry a
quiet resentment (gossip topic, dialogue flavor), while `temple_np` is publicly
aligned with the bloodline yet harbors doubters (the novice, a scholar). The
`cooperage_circle` exists mostly as recoverable lore + a few sympathizers.

---

## 4. Civic infrastructure (designed once; sited ON the arteries; where routines cross)

| Civic node | District | Artery position | Routine role |
|------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Central Square great market | Merchant | the crossing | everyone shops; surveillance beat; the heart |
| Carter's Rise well + flower market | Common | Processional (Common stretch) | dawn water; the hollow-accusation scene |
| A neighborhood tavern (the Brimming Bowl) | Common | Processional | commonfolk evenings; conversation hub |
| A cookshop / street-food row | Common | Processional | commonfolk midday meals |
| The Salt Cellar (inn/tavern) | Docks | Long Market, west end | dockfolk evenings; transient lodging |
| A dockside cookshop | Docks | Long Market | dock midday meals |
| Aldric's public house (canon) | Docks | off the Long Market | rough lodging, no questions |
| The Gilt Threshold (high inn) | Merchant | near the Square | merchant-class social; Horst's quiet meetings |
| The Grand Temple | Temple | Long Market, east end | rest, **respawn**, worship; pilgrim arrival |
| A bathhouse | Common/Merchant seam | Processional | cross-class mixing |
| The fighting pit (stub) | Common | off the Processional | gambling/combat social (expansion stub) |
| A well per residential cluster | each | local | morning water; small-talk node |

Each is a node where NPC schedules converge (meal segments → cookshops, evening →
taverns, dawn → wells, rest-day → temple) and 3.6 conversations fire. **Respawn
point: the Grand Temple.**

---

## 5. Supply map (spatial, visible daily)

**Single import origin → distribution by mini-caravan along the Long Market.**

- The **Docks warehouse cluster + caravan depot** (run by the warehouse master,
  Dunmar Wells) is where *all* imported goods land and are stored.
- The **mini-caravan runner** (Dobb) loads at the depot and walks the **Long
  Market** east — Crafting → Central Square → Temple — branching south to Common,
  delivering to each district's vendors (the chunk-3.8 oneshot runner-delivery
  pattern; engine already ships). The import economy is something players *watch
  move through the streets*.
- **Every crafter anchor's `supply_source`** resolves to Dunmar's warehouse or
  the delivering caravan (e.g., Halvard's iron, Vesna's reagents, Corwin's hides,
  Nessa's cloth). Finished goods then move *between* artisans/vendors (Nessa's
  cloth → Aurel's Noble atelier; Halvard's blades → Ostry's Merchant shop).
- **Food/water:** cookshops source from the Central market; wells give water.
- **Engine wiring** (built during the Docks build, per the pricing-fix spec §2):
  add the NP zones to `CaravanServedZones`; register `np_docks_runner_circuit` +
  its delivery buckets (~6 lines); Dunmar = a Dock-Master merchant (not in
  `CaravanServedZones`) whose overstock the runner drains. Phase-2 routes (farm/
  timber/ore/forage via Kingsbarrow Vale / Kilnreach Works) layer in later.

---

## 7. The cross-district web (coherence check)

The roster is woven, not a flat list. The load-bearing threads:

- **Family/meals:** Marda (Common cookshop) ↔ Halvard (Crafting smith) — siblings who eat midday together (a daily cross-district routine).
- **The supply spine:** Dunmar's warehouse (Docks) → Dobb's caravan → Halvard/Vesna/Corwin/Nessa (Crafting) → onward (Nessa → Aurel/Noble; Halvard → Ostry/Merchant). One economy, visibly moving.
- **Drink supply:** Renn Bowl's Common brewery → Bressa's Salt Cellar (Docks).
- **The lore web (pre-Founding + cooperage):** Gritta (Old Q) → Coll (Common) + Orin (Crafting); Orin ↔ Novice Ept + Dross (Temple); cooperage sympathizers Toby, Edda, Lysha (Crafting/Noble).
- **The Bloom Trail:** Deren (Old Q) → Marn (Docks); Quill (Old Q) witness; Wenna (Noble) knows the delivery house; Ysolde (Common) treats the addicted.
- **The bloodline's reach:** Horst (Merchant) → Clerk Vell → Steward Caldwin (Noble) → Skell, Doryn, Holt — felt as tribute/checkpoints, resented by Mother Brisk / dockfolk.
- **Cross-class comrades:** Garrick One-Hand (Common pit) ↔ Guard-Captain Doryn (Palace).
- **Healers, mirrored:** Sister Alms (Temple, legit) vs. Ysolde (Common, no-questions).

These become 1.6 relationship edges + supply links + faction reps when each
district is built; they are why a smith lives in one quarter and works in another.

---

## 8. How district builds consume this layer

Each district (Docks-first: Docks → Common → Crafting → Merchant → Temple →
Noble → Old Quarter) gets its own spec → plan → build that:
1. Pulls its **anchors** from §6 and authors full life-sheets (home/work rooms,
   24h `schedule_id`, dialogue ≥3 topics, the unique mutation).
2. Lays out rooms within its **coordinate region** (§2), honoring the arteries +
   civic nodes (§4), `cartcheck`-clean; updates `docs/coordinate_map.md`.
3. Wires **relationships** (§7), **faction** membership (§3), and **supply
   links** (§5).
4. Adds **ambient + transient** residents (pooled cluster schedules) to fill the
   streets.
5. Authors its **questline** (master plan §8–9) + expansion stubs.
6. The **Docks build additionally** does the §5 engine wiring (CaravanServedZones
   + `np_docks_runner_circuit` + Dunmar as Dock-Master) and the Bloom Trail
   opening.

---

## 9. Open items / next step

- **Name-collision check — DONE 2026-06-20.** All §6 invented names verified
  against the world mob roster; renamed the runner (→ Dobb) and the scavenger
  (→ Gritta) to avoid Hartcharn's *Severin Pell*/*Goodwife Pella* and North Road
  North's *Old Mabbot*.
- **Bloom IS becoming a real mechanic** (user decision 2026-06-20) — an
  addiction / withdrawal / toxicity system (likely buffs 90–95 + a bark-skin
  progression à la canon). **Deferred until after NP content is in:** author the
  Bloom Trail *narratively* first (Deren, Marn, the captive, breadcrumbs across
  Docks/Old Quarter/Noble), then layer the mechanic over the placed content as
  its own spec→plan→build. Tracked: [[project-bloom-mechanic]].
- writing-plans → the **Docks district** is the first build sub-project (its own
  spec→plan→build per §8; it carries the supply-engine wiring + the Bloom Trail
  opening). It is a large build — best started with full focus.
