# Combat State — Chunk 4c: Position × Weapon Utility (Reach Model) Design

> **Side quest from mob aliveness chunk 2.7.** Sub-chunk 4c of the
> combat-state-machines redesign (master spec:
> `docs/superpowers/specs/completed/2026-05-13-combat-state-machines-design.md`).
> Third of six sub-chunks in the rich-grapple expansion (master-spec
> section "3a. Position rich-grapple expansion"):
>
>   - 4a (shipped) — Position FSM scaffold.
>   - 4b (shipped) — Control-axis mechanics + cutover.
>   - **4c (this spec)** — Weapon utility by position via a single
>     `reach` field on ItemSpec + position-radius curve. Long weapons
>     degrade in grapples; daggers stay useful; sword-in-mount narrates
>     as bludgeoning the target with the pommel instead of slashing.
>   - 4d — Submission system rework.
>   - 4e — Third-party interaction asymmetries.
>   - 4f — Balance pass + flavor text + full-stack smoke.
>
> **Aliveness paused for the duration** of chunks 1-6.

## Goal

Make weapon choice in grapples matter. After chunk 4b shipped, the
Position FSM drives 14 distinct geometric states and per-round control
drift, but combat damage in those states is currently weapon-agnostic
— a polearm in mount swings for the same numbers as a dagger in mount.
That's wrong both fictionally (you can't lever a spear with a guy on
top of you) and mechanically (no incentive to carry a backup short
weapon, no skill expression in weapon choice).

4c introduces a single `reach` field (meters) on `ItemSpec` and a
position-radius curve. The combat pipeline multiplies in a reach
utility factor: weapons whose reach exceeds the position's effective
radius are penalized; weapons whose reach fits the radius pay no
penalty. The attack-message vocabulary swaps to a bludgeoning set
when the penalty fires, so the player sees "you slam the iron
sword's pommel into their ribs" instead of "you slash awkwardly with
the iron sword" — fiction tracks math.

End state: tactical weapon-swapping in grapples becomes a real
choice. Carrying a dagger as an offhand becomes a viable response
to a grappler. Two-handed reach weapons (spear, halberd, pike,
greatsword, quarterstaff) become liabilities once a clinch lands.
Natural attacks (fist, claws, bite) keep their effectiveness in
ground-grapple because their reach is short by definition.

## Non-goals (4c)

- **Damage-type swap in the mitigation pipeline.** A sword swung
  as a pommel-bludgeon still applies physical damage against the
  physical mitigation channel. The bludgeoning angle is narrative
  only (attack-message vocabulary). Routing sword damage through
  the Crushing armor profile is future balance work, not 4c.
- **Reach affects defense.** Only the attack side reads reach in 4c.
  A defender parrying with a long weapon in a clinch isn't penalized
  by this system. (Real BJJ: it should be — but defense scoring is
  already a tangle in `combat_helpers.go`; tackle in 4f or later.)
- **Weapon weight cross-reference.** Weight stays focused on
  encumbrance + swing speed. A spear isn't bad in mount because
  it's heavy; it's bad because it's long. Two axes of penalty would
  double-count.
- **Per-grapple-state reach overrides.** All 11 grapple states use
  one of two radii (standing-grapple, ground-grapple). Mount and
  HalfGuard share the same effective radius for reach purposes.
  Position-specific weapon quirks (e.g., dagger in BackGround gets
  a bonus because exposed neck) are 4f flavor passes.
- **Stand × downed positioning.** When attacker is Standing and
  target is Prone/Supine, no reach penalty applies — attacker can
  swing freely from above. Only triggers when attacker `IsGrappling()`.
- **Reach as physical range for ranged combat.** A bow's reach in
  this model is its melee-fallback reach (used as a club). The
  shooting-range concept lives in a different field (`Range` or
  similar) and is unrelated to 4c.
- **Compound reach (arm length + weapon haft).** Future Reach refinement
  per the user's chunk-4c kickoff conversation. 4c uses weapon reach
  only; arm length is a perfect-information gap that adds noise without
  affecting balance materially at MUD-fidelity resolution.
- **Player-facing reach display.** The `examine` / `identify`
  commands gain reach in 4c (it's a stat), but no UI element
  surfaces "reach: dangerous in grapple" warnings. Player learns
  by feel + helpfile.

## Architecture

The work is small relative to 4a/4b. One new field on `ItemSpec`, one
new helper in the items package (default reach by subtype), one new
combat-helper function that computes the multiplier, two integration
points in `combat/grapple.go` / `combat/skill_moves.go` / wherever the
attack pipeline calls `CalcRawDamage`, and one tweak to the
`GetAttackMessage` call site to swap subtype for narration.

No new state machine, no FSM changes, no new btree primitives. 4c is
the cheap chunk between the heavyweight 4b cutover and the
heavyweight 4d submission rework.

## Reach taxonomy

The single source of truth lives in `internal/items/reach.go` as the
`DefaultReachForSubtype` map. Values are weapon-only reach in meters;
arm length is intentionally excluded (chunk-4c-kickoff decision).
Authors override per-item only for outliers (e.g., a particularly
short shortsword, a ceremonial dagger with an oversized hilt).

### Natural attacks
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Fist | 0.1 | Punch length |
| Claws | 0.15 | Fingers extended |
| Bite | 0.15 | Head-mounted, neck-length |
| Sting | 0.2 | Abdomen/tail-tip |
| Slam | 0.3 | Bull rush, shoulder-check |
| Gore | 0.4 | Horn-tip from skull base |
| Whipping (natural — e.g., tail mutation) | 1.0 | Tail length |

### Light melee
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dagger | 0.3 | Hilt to tip |
| Knuckles / brass | 0.1 | Treats as enhanced fist |
| Hatchet (handle ≤ 0.5m) | 0.4 | Throwing-axe size |

### Medium melee
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Shortsword | 0.7 | Roman gladius family |
| Mace | 0.8 | One-handed |
| Axe (one-handed) | 0.9 | Battle-axe handle |
| Sword (longsword, one-handed) | 1.0 | Classic arming sword |
| Whip (entanglement) | 0.5 | Operational radius wrapped, not extended |
| Flail (one-handed) | 1.0 | Haft + chain + head |
| Rapier | 1.1 | Long thin blade |

### Heavy / two-handed melee
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Battleaxe (two-handed) | 1.2 | |
| Greatsword | 1.5 | |
| Quarterstaff | 1.5 | |
| War hammer (two-handed) | 1.4 | |
| Spear | 2.0 | |
| Trident | 2.0 | |
| Glaive | 2.2 | Polearm with blade |
| Naginata | 2.3 | |
| Halberd | 2.5 | Polearm with axe head |
| Scythe (weaponized) | 1.8 | |
| Pike | 3.0+ | Formation weapon; effectively unusable in grapple |

### Exotic
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Kusarigama | 0.6 (kama end) / 2.0 (chain) | Use 0.6 — kama end is the operational reach in close quarters |
| Javelin (melee) | 1.7 | Used as short spear when held |
| Throwing knife | 0.3 | Same as dagger |
| Blowgun | 0.4 | Used as a striking rod in melee |
| Sling | 0.2 | Hand-only operational reach when not winding up |

### Ranged (melee-fallback reach)
Used when the ranged weapon must function as a melee club (grappled
target, no room to draw/aim). Shooting-range is a separate field.
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Shortbow | 1.0 | Used as a stave |
| Longbow | 1.5 | Used as a stave |
| Crossbow | 0.7 | Compact heavy |
| Heavy crossbow | 0.9 | Bigger frame |

### Caster
| Subtype | Reach (m) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Wand | 0.4 | Foot-long focus |
| Sceptre | 0.6 | Larger ornamented focus |
| Staff (caster) | 1.5 | Quarterstaff equivalent in close quarters |

### Authoring guidance (for context.md)

Authors creating new weapon items SHOULD:
1. Leave `reach` empty in YAML for normal items of a known subtype
   (the engine applies the default-by-subtype value).
2. Set `reach: <meters>` only when the item is unusual (e.g., "this
   particular dagger has a 0.5m blade — set reach: 0.5").
3. Use meters, not abstract units. Real-world references help
   balancing.
4. For wholly new subtypes, add a row to `DefaultReachForSubtype`
   in `internal/items/reach.go` and update the context.md table.

## Position radius curve

Two effective radii in 4c — kept simple deliberately. Per-state
refinement is 4f flavor work.

| Position class | Radius (m) | States |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Not grappling | ∞ (no penalty) | Standing, Prone, Supine, Turtle (defensive curl, opponent not engaging at grapple-radius) |
| Standing grapple | 0.5 | Clinch, BackStanding |
| Ground grapple | 0.3 | Mount, SideControl, KneeOnBelly, NorthSouth, Crucifix, BackGround, HalfGuard, Guard |

**Standing alone is unbounded** — a fighter standing upright at conversational
distance is not "in a grapple" so reach plays normally regardless of
target position. A standing attacker over a downed (Prone/Supine)
target also pays no reach penalty — they have room to swing.

**Turtle is unbounded too** — it's a defensive ball, not a pair
position. The Turtle player isn't grappling; if someone WAS grappling
them they'd be in BackGround or Crucifix.

The radius lookup lives in `combat.PositionReachRadius(s position.State) float64`.
Returns 0 (sentinel "no penalty") for non-grapple states.

Configurable via balance config:
- `ReachStandingGrappleRadius` (default `0.5`)
- `ReachGroundGrappleRadius` (default `0.3`)

## Utility formula

```
func ReachUtility(weaponReach, posRadius float64) float64 {
    if posRadius == 0 { return 1.0 } // not grappling — full damage
    if weaponReach <= posRadius { return 1.0 } // weapon fits — no penalty
    util := posRadius / weaponReach
    if util < ReachUtilityFloor { return ReachUtilityFloor }
    return util
}
```

Worked examples (defaults: standing-grapple radius 0.5, ground-grapple
radius 0.3, floor 0.15):

| Weapon | Reach | Standing-grapple | Ground-grapple |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fist | 0.1 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Dagger | 0.3 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Sword | 1.0 | 0.50 | 0.30 |
| Greatsword | 1.5 | 0.33 | 0.20 |
| Spear | 2.0 | 0.25 | 0.15 (floored) |
| Pike | 3.0 | 0.17 | 0.15 (floored) |
| Wand | 0.4 | 1.00 | 0.75 |
| Caster-staff | 1.5 | 0.33 | 0.20 |

Floor at 0.15 keeps the weapon from doing literal zero damage — you
can always at least poke or thrust the pommel for chip damage. Tunable
if smoke says "pike in mount should be 0.05".

## Damage pipeline integration

Existing pipeline (recap):
```
rawDmg = CalcRawDamage(stat, skillRank, itemMult, channel)
finalDmg = ApplyMitigation(rawDmg, mitPct, mitCap)
displayed = dice.RollStat(finalDmg)
```

4c change: `itemMult` becomes reach-adjusted at every site that
currently passes a weapon's `damage_multiplier`. The convenience
helper:

```go
// CalcReachAdjustedItemMult returns the weapon's damage_multiplier
// scaled by ReachUtility for the attacker's current Position. Use
// this everywhere CalcRawDamage's itemMult argument was previously
// fed weaponSpec.DamageMultiplier.
//
// For natural-attack contexts (unarmed, mob fist/claws/bite), the
// caller passes the natural-attack pseudo-spec; reach defaults to
// the subtype's natural-attack reach (fist=0.1, etc.).
func CalcReachAdjustedItemMult(
    weapon items.Item,
    attacker *characters.Character,
) float64 {
    spec := weapon.GetSpec()
    baseMult := spec.DamageMultiplier
    reach := items.ResolveReach(spec)
    posRadius := PositionReachRadius(attacker.Position.State())
    return baseMult * ReachUtility(reach, posRadius)
}
```

Sites to update:
- `combat/skill_moves.go:ExecuteSkillMove` — uses `p.DamagePercent`
  directly today; needs to wrap if attacker has a weapon. (Skill
  moves like grapple/trip/bash are stat-driven and weapon-agnostic;
  may not need reach adjustment at all. Decide per-move during
  implementation — kick already routes through subtype, so likely
  yes; grapple is force, likely no.)
- `internal/hooks/NewRound_DoCombat_helpers.go` — main per-swing
  damage path. Replace `weaponSpec.DamageMultiplier` reads with
  `CalcReachAdjustedItemMult(weapon, attacker)` calls. This is the
  hot path; expect ~3-5 sites.
- `internal/hooks/spell_resolution.go` — spells aren't reach-gated
  (4c non-goal), so no change. (The caster-weapon `spell_damage_multiplier`
  stays unaffected; staves in mount are bad for melee but the spell
  still casts normally. Future 4f could revisit if "casting in mount"
  becomes a balance issue.)

## Attack-message vocabulary swap (bludgeon narration)

When `ReachUtility < 1.0` AND original subtype is bladed/piercing,
the message-selection site swaps to the Crushing pattern. Message
templates already use `{weapon}` and `{target}` tokens, so a sword
narrated as Crushing renders correctly: "You slam the iron sword's
pommel against the bandit's ribs" — the template just needs to be
written that way for the Crushing set.

Predicate:
```go
func ShouldBludgeon(weaponReach, posRadius float64) bool {
    return posRadius > 0 && weaponReach > posRadius
}
```

Site:
```go
// Before:
msg := items.GetAttackMessage(weaponSpec.Subtype, pctDmg)

// After:
displaySubtype := weaponSpec.Subtype
if combat.ShouldBludgeon(items.ResolveReach(weaponSpec), combat.PositionReachRadius(attacker.Position.State())) {
    // Long weapon in close quarters narrates as a club/bludgeon
    // strike regardless of bladed/piercing classification.
    if weaponSpec.Subtype == items.Slashing || weaponSpec.Subtype == items.Cleaving ||
        weaponSpec.Subtype == items.Stabbing || weaponSpec.Subtype == items.Shooting {
        displaySubtype = items.Crushing
    }
}
msg := items.GetAttackMessage(displaySubtype, pctDmg)
```

Naturally-blunt subtypes (Slam, Gore, Whipping, Fist) keep their
existing vocabulary even if `ShouldBludgeon` fires — they're already
blunt.

Caster weapons (Wand, Sceptre, Staff) when used for melee already
read as bludgeoning-flavored in their existing messages; no special
handling needed (the swap is for blades).

## YAML migration plan

Phase 1 (in 4c, mechanical): no YAML changes required. Every existing
weapon inherits the default reach for its subtype via `ResolveReach`.
Combat behavior changes immediately — daggers stay punchy in grapples,
swords degrade, polearms become bludgeons.

Phase 2 (post-4c, balance feedback): per-item overrides for outliers.
Add `reach: <meters>` to specific YAMLs as smoke surfaces "this
particular dagger should be 0.5m" cases.

The audit script `tools/id_inventory.py` (or a new sibling) can
optionally scan for weapons with `reach: 0` that should probably
have a default — but the engine already handles zero by falling
through to the subtype default, so this is purely a hygiene check
for hand-authored values being intentional.

## Behavior matrix preview

## Sunset list (4c)

Nothing sunset in 4c. All deletions belonged to 4b. 4c adds; it
doesn't remove.

## Persistence

`Reach` lives on `ItemSpec`, which is template-loaded from YAML at
boot. Per-instance items don't persist reach (it's not a runtime
mutable field). Saved character/mob YAMLs don't need migration —
just bump the engine and weapons start respecting position-radius
penalties.

If 4d/4e adds runtime per-item reach modifiers (e.g., a "broken
hilt" debuff that shortens a weapon's effective reach), that goes
on `Item.RuntimeData` or similar, separate from spec-default reach.
Out of 4c scope.

## Open questions / risks

1. **Should grapple-rolls themselves read reach?** (E.g., a fighter
   carrying a polearm has a harder time initiating a clinch because
   the polearm is in the way.) Probably yes for realism but 4c
   defers — reach only affects damage in 4c. 4d's submission rework
   is the natural place to revisit grapple-roll modifiers; reach
   could enter there.
2. **Two-handed reach when offhand is empty.** If a character is
   wielding a one-handed sword in a clinch but their offhand is
   free, real-world they'd probably drop the sword and grapple
   bare-handed. We don't model "drop weapon" in MUDs typically.
   Solution: just accept the penalty. Player can manually `remove
   sword` and grapple unarmed if they want. Document in helpfile.
3. **Two-weapon fighters.** If wielding dagger offhand + sword
   main-hand, the player would want to swing the dagger in mount,
   not the sword. Current swing scheduling alternates main + offhand
   per round. Per-swing reach evaluation handles this correctly —
   each swing reads the weapon being swung. No special handling.
4. **Mob natural-attack reach.** Mobs without weapons fall through
   to the unarmed combat path. Need a clean way to map mob-species
   natural-attack subtype (claws, bite, gore, etc.) to a reach value
   for the multiplier calc. `ResolveReach` should accept a "natural
   attack subtype" lookup path that doesn't require a real ItemSpec
   — likely a `ResolveNaturalReach(subtype ItemSubType) float64`
   sibling helper that just hits `DefaultReachForSubtype`.
5. **Performance.** Per-swing reach computation is two map lookups
   + a float division. Trivial. No caching needed.
6. **Reach floor calibration.** The 0.15 floor (pike in mount does
   15% damage) might be too generous — a pike in mount realistically
   does zero. Smoke testing decides. Tunable via balance config.
7. **Player visibility.** Without an in-game way to see reach
   values, players will discover the penalty by feel. Acceptable
   for first release; a `weaponstats <weapon>` admin command or
   reach-in-identify enhancement can land later.
8. **Compound reach (arm length + weapon).** User flagged this in
   chunk-4c kickoff as "problem for later." 4c uses weapon-only
   reach; arm length introduces species/size variance (Salamandri
   vs Skeleton vs Lumix) without affecting balance at MUD-fidelity
   resolution. Future spec if it becomes load-bearing.
9. **Defense-side reach.** A defender in mount with a polearm
   parry-rolling against a dagger attacker is currently unpenalized.
   Realism says they should be. Defense scoring is gnarly
   (`combat/combat_helpers.go` best-of-all defense) and adding
   reach to it risks regressions. 4c keeps it offense-side only;
   4f flavor pass can revisit if combat feels asymmetric.

## Resumption criteria (chunk 4c done when)

- `Reach` field exists on `ItemSpec`, loaded from YAML, defaults to
  zero (sentinel for "use subtype default").
- `items.DefaultReachForSubtype` and `items.ResolveReach` shipped;
  `ResolveReach` correctly falls through subtype default for zero
  reaches and uses explicit value when set.
- `combat.PositionReachRadius`, `combat.ReachUtility`, and
  `combat.ShouldBludgeon` shipped with the radius curve and
  utility formula above.
- `combat.CalcReachAdjustedItemMult` shipped and used at every
  per-swing damage site (NewRound_DoCombat_helpers, kick variants
  inside skill_moves where appropriate).
- Attack-message vocabulary swap fires for bladed weapons in
  grapple positions (`ShouldBludgeon → true`).
- Reach values authored in `internal/items/context.md` reference
  table; weapon authoring SOP documented.
- Balance knobs (`ReachStandingGrappleRadius`,
  `ReachGroundGrappleRadius`, `ReachUtilityFloor`) live in
  `internal/configs/balance.go`.
- Behavior Matrix PB-201 through PB-220 PASS or SKIP per plan.
- Chunks 0-4b regression clean.
- Server boots cleanly past data-file loading.

## Out-of-scope / future followup candidates

- Defense-side reach penalty in grapples (long parry weapons should
  be hard to use defensively from mount).
- Per-grapple-state radius overrides (e.g., BackGround tighter than
  Mount).
- Compound reach (arm length + weapon haft) for species-level reach
  variance.
- Reach affecting grapple-entry rolls (long-weapon wielder harder
  to clinch).
- Player-facing reach UI (identify integration, encumbrance-style
  prompt token).
- Per-weapon override values for the 200ish existing weapons (post-
  smoke balance).
- Casting-while-grappled penalties (caster-staff in mount degrades
  spell damage too? Currently only melee).
- "Drop weapon to grapple" mechanic — auto or manual.
- Pommel-strike / bash with reach > radius as an explicit skill
  move (instead of just damage degradation).
