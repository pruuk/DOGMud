# Intentional Command Divergences

Documents all intentional differences between user and mob command
systems, with rationale for each.

The authoritative source of truth is `internal/actions/divergences.go`
(`userOnlyCommands` and `mobOnlyCommands` maps). This file summarises
the design intent behind each category; the code is the single source
of allowlist membership.

## Player Mechanics (User-Only)

Commands that implement systems that do not exist for mob AI.

| Command | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| assist | Party system — mobs do not form parties |
| party | Party system — mobs do not form parties |
| share | Party XP/loot share — mobs do not form parties |
| reply | Private messaging — mobs use `say`/`sayto` |
| whisper | Private messaging — mobs use `say`/`sayto` |
| target | Targeting UI — mobs use AI targeting logic |
| start | Character creation entry point |
| zombieact | Zombie player state handling |

## Mob AI Commands (Mob-Only) — 22 commands

Commands implemented only for mob AI scripts and behaviour routines.
Players do not have access to these; they are driven by the mob AI loop,
not by direct input.

| Command | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| aid | Assist a nearby ally in combat |
| befriend | Attempt to befriend a target |
| callforhelp | Broadcast a call-for-help to nearby mobs |
| charge | Rush at a target, initiating combat |
| consume | Eat/drink an item in inventory |
| converse | Initiate scripted NPC conversation |
| despawn | Remove the mob from the world |
| givequest | Grant a quest token to a player |
| hamstring | Cripple target movement speed |
| lookforaid | Scan for allies to request help from |
| lookfortrouble | Scan for hostile targets to engage |
| pathto | Navigate toward a destination room |
| portal | Create a temporary portal |
| replyto | Respond to a specific player |
| sayto | Direct speech at a specific target |
| saytoonly | Speak only to a specific target (no room echo) |
| wander | Roam randomly through connected rooms |

### Mob-Only: Pending Consolidation

These mob commands duplicate or overlap existing player systems and are
candidates for removal or unification in future stages.

| Command | Category | Plan |
|---------|----------|------|
| howl | mob-ai | Renamed taunt — unify with shared taunt action |
| backstab | mob-ai | Redundant with surprise strike system — remove |
| roar | mob-ai | Future player shout/intimidation system |
| throw | mob-ai | Future player ranged ability |
| alchemy | mob-alchemy | Consolidate with shared craft system |

---

## Pending Consolidation

These are the highest-priority targets for future unification work:

- **howl** → unify with `taunt` (same conviction damage mechanic, mob
  renames it for flavour but the action is identical)
- **backstab** → remove (redundant with surprise strike; the distinction
  is not meaningful for mob AI)
- **roar** → add player intimidation/shout system, then share the action
- **throw** → add player ranged ability, then share the action
- **alchemy** → consolidate with shared `craft` system introduced in
  Stage 5 of the command unification project

## Behavioral Asymmetries (By Design)

Some commands exist on both sides but are intentionally implemented
differently for players vs mobs. These are NOT bugs.

### Flee
- **Players**: enter a flee-attempt state that is resolved by the combat
  loop on the next tick. Failure is possible (opponent too strong, no
  exits available). The delay creates tension.
- **Mobs**: flee is resolved immediately. Mob AI needs instant escape to
  maintain flow control; a delayed resolution would break state machines.

### Sneak Initiation
- **Players**: gated by Skullduggery skill rank >= 1; failure triggers a
  cooldown preventing re-attempt for several rounds.
- **Mobs**: skill gate and failure cooldown are skipped entirely. Mob
  sneak decisions come from AI scripts, not player-style skill checks.

### ~~Spell Initiation~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-12 (roadmap U0)
This divergence no longer exists. The player-only initiation roll was
**deleted**, so players and mobs now begin casting on the same terms.

It was documented as "rewards investment in Willpower and spellcasting",
which was the opposite of what it did. `CalcInitiationChance` clamped at
95 while a maxed caster's computed value was 1372, so investment could
never move it: every caster failed one cast in twenty forever, each
failure carrying a 2-round cooldown. Concentration break covers the
design intent and does respond to skill.

Do not reintroduce a flat initiation gate. See roadmap U9 for the
concentration rework that supersedes it.

### Progression Events
- **Players**: fire `events.SkillUsed` (carries `UserId`); the event
  system applies probabilistic advancement.
- **Mobs**: call `OnSkillUse`/`OnStatUse` directly because the
  `events.SkillUsed` struct carries only `UserId` — there is no
  `MobInstanceId` field. This is a structural limitation of the event
  system, not an intentional design choice; it should be unified if the
  event struct is extended.

## Aliases (User-Only)

These user-side command names route to shared actions with variant
detection. The underlying shared action works for both players and mobs;
only the alias name is user-only.

| Alias | Routes To | Condition |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| stomp | kick | Target is prone |
| knee | kick | Actor is grappling and in control |
| tailsweep | trip | Actor has the Tail mutation |

Mob AI scripts invoke the underlying command (`kick`, `trip`) directly
and the variant is detected inside the shared action handler by checking
combat state. The aliases exist purely as convenience shortcuts for
human typists.
