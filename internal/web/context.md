# GoMud Web Server and Admin Interface Context

## Overview

The GoMud web system provides a comprehensive HTTP/HTTPS server with both public web client functionality and secure administrative interfaces. It supports WebSocket connections for real-time game clients, template-based HTML rendering, plugin integration, and extensive admin tools for managing game content including rooms, items, mobs, races, and mutators.

## Architecture

The web system is built around Go's standard `net/http` package with several key components:

### Core Components

**HTTP Server Management:**
- Dual HTTP/HTTPS server support with configurable ports
- TLS certificate validation and configuration
- Automatic HTTPS redirect capability
- WebSocket upgrade handling for real-time clients
- Graceful shutdown with timeout management

**Template System:**
- Go `text/template` based HTML rendering
- Automatic inclusion of `_*.html` template files
- Plugin template override capability
- Custom template functions for formatting and logic
- Dynamic navigation menu generation

**Authentication and Security:**
- HTTP Basic Authentication for admin areas
- Role-based access control (admin/user roles)
- Authentication caching (30-minute sessions)
- Game state mutex locking for concurrent access protection
- Directory traversal protection

**Plugin Integration:**
- `WebPlugin` interface for module web extensions
- Dynamic navigation link management
- Custom request handling and template data injection
- Static file serving for plugin assets

## Key Features

## Plugin Integration

### WebPlugin Interface
```go
type WebPlugin interface {
    // Return navigation links for menu integration
    NavLinks() map[string]string
    
    // Handle custom web requests
    WebRequest(r *http.Request) (html string, templateData map[string]any, ok bool)
}
```

### Plugin Registration
```go
// In main.go
web.SetWebPlugin(plugins.GetPluginRegistry())

// Plugin implementation
func (p *MyPlugin) NavLinks() map[string]string {
    return map[string]string{
        "My Feature": "/myplugin/dashboard",
        "Settings":   "/myplugin/config",
    }
}

func (p *MyPlugin) WebRequest(r *http.Request) (string, map[string]any, bool) {
    if strings.HasPrefix(r.URL.Path, "/myplugin/") {
        html := "<h1>Custom Plugin Page</h1>"
        data := map[string]any{
            "PluginData": "Custom content",
        }
        return html, data, true
    }
    return "", nil, false
}
```

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. **Request Interception**: Admin routes protected by `doBasicAuth` middleware
2. **Cache Check**: Grants cached for `authCacheTTL` (30 min), keyed on a
   SHA-256 of the `Authorization` header — never the header itself, which is
   base64(user:password)
3. **Revalidation**: at most once per `authRevalidateEvery` (30 s) a cache hit
   re-reads the user record and voids the grant if the stored password hash or
   the role changed, or the account is gone
4. **Throttle**: past the cache, a source that failed `authMaxFailures` (5)
   times inside `authFailureWindow` (5 min) gets `429` + `Retry-After` for
   `authLockoutDur` (1 min), *before* any bcrypt work
5. **Credential Validation**: Username/password verified against user database
6. **Role Verification**: User must have admin or higher role
7. **Access Granted**: Request proceeds to handler with mutex protection

**Gotcha — `authCache`/`authFailures` are guarded by `authMu`, not by the world
lock.** Every `/admin/*` route happens to be wrapped in `RunWithMUDLocked`,
which serialized these maps *by accident*. `GET /build` and `GET /build-help`
deliberately are not (the build page must not hold the world lock), so an
unauthenticated flood of `/build` used to race an admin authenticating anywhere
in the admin UI and kill the process with `concurrent map read and map write`.
Do not "fix" that by wrapping `/build` in `RunWithMUDLocked`.

**Gotcha — the failure tracker is keyed by attacker-controlled connection
data.** It is swept every write and hard-capped at `authTrackerMaxEntries`,
evicting the least-recently-failed entry at capacity. Any future per-source map
here needs the same treatment.

### Real client IP behind a proxy (`clientip.go`)

```go
func ResolveClientIP(r *http.Request) string  // bare IP, no port
```

Production fronts the web client with Caddy, so `r.RemoteAddr` and a
websocket's `RemoteAddr()` are the proxy (`127.0.0.1`) for every player. Use
`ResolveClientIP` for anything that decides *who someone is*: it is what the
`/ws` upgrade records on `ConnectionDetails.SetClientIP` (making IP bans work
for web-client players) and what `doBasicAuth` throttles on (so one attacker
does not lock out every admin sharing the proxy's address).

**Security contract — do not loosen either half:**

1. `X-Forwarded-For` is read **only** when the socket peer is in
   `Network.TrustedProxies`. That list defaults to loopback and nothing else.
   A remote attacker cannot forge their socket peer, so they cannot get their
   header read at all. Believing the header unconditionally would be *worse*
   than the original bug — anyone could send `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` and
   become loopback, which is exempt from ban checks for everyone.
2. Within the header, the **rightmost** hop that is not itself a trusted proxy
   wins. Proxies append, so a client's pre-seeded value ends up to the left and
   is never reached. Taking the leftmost entry — the common mistake — hands the
   attacker full control of the result.

Widening `TrustedProxies` to a private range trusts every host in that range to
claim any identity. List only the addresses your own proxy connects from.
Assumes the proxy appends rather than overwrites (Caddy's `reverse_proxy`
default).

### Websocket admission control (`wsguard.go`)

```go
func wsCapacityExceeded() (exceeded bool, active int, max int)
func wsOriginAllowed(r *http.Request) bool   // wired as upgrader.CheckOrigin
```

`/ws` applies three gates, in this order:

1. **Connection cap.** Reuses `Network.MaxTelnetConnections` rather than adding
   a websocket knob, because that is what the limit already means: the telnet
   listener compares it against `connections.ActiveConnectionCount()`, which
   counts *every* registered connection, websockets included. `/ws` previously
   had no cap at all, so it both bypassed the limit and could starve telnet out
   of the shared pool. Over-cap upgrades get `503` + `Retry-After` before the
   upgrade, so the client sees a real status instead of an instantly-closed
   socket. `max <= 0` means unlimited, matching the localhost admin port.
2. **Origin check.** `CheckOrigin` used to `return true` unconditionally, so
   any third-party page could open sockets from a visitor's browser. Now: no
   `Origin` header → allow (non-browser clients omit it; browsers always send
   it on a handshake, so absence is not a cross-origin signal); Origin hostname
   == `r.Host` hostname → allow (same-origin, works behind Caddy since Host is
   preserved); hostname in `FilePaths.WebDomain` / `Server.MSSP.Hostname` /
   loopback / `Network.AllowedWebSocketOrigins` → allow; otherwise reject.
   Comparison is hostname-only — a port match adds nothing, since an attacker
   holding a port on an allowed hostname already controls that origin.
3. **`SetReadLimit(wsMaxMessageBytes)`** after the upgrade (from the earlier
   unbounded-frame fix). Leave it.

`Network.AllowedWebSocketOrigins` defaults to empty, which is the restrictive
setting. Each entry is a domain trusted to drive connections on a visitor's
behalf — only add one when the client is genuinely served from another domain.

### Game State Protection
```go
// All admin operations wrapped with mutex
func RunWithMUDLocked(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        util.LockMud()
        defer util.UnlockMud()
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

## Configuration and Setup

### Network Configuration
```yaml
network:
  http_port: 80              # HTTP server port (0 to disable)
  https_port: 443            # HTTPS server port (0 to disable)
  https_redirect: true       # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

file_paths:
  public_html: "_datafiles/html/public"
  admin_html: "_datafiles/html/admin"
  https_cert_file: "cert.pem"
  https_key_file: "key.pem"
```

### Server Startup Process
1. **Configuration Validation**: Check ports and certificate files
2. **Route Registration**: Set up all HTTP handlers and middleware
3. **HTTPS Server**: Start with TLS configuration if certificates available
4. **HTTP Server**: Start with optional HTTPS redirect
5. **WebSocket Handler**: Register upgrade endpoint for game clients

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /` - Homepage and static content
- `GET /ws` - WebSocket upgrade for game clients. Inbound frames are capped at
  `wsMaxMessageBytes` (64 KiB) via `conn.SetReadLimit` right after the upgrade —
  gorilla's default is unlimited and `ReadMessage` buffers a whole frame, so
  without the cap an unauthenticated client can force an arbitrary allocation.
  The handler passed in (`main.HandleWebSocketConnection`) owns removing the
  connection from the `connections` registry on every exit path.
- `GET /favicon.ico` - Favicon redirect
- `GET /<path>` - Template-processed HTML pages

### Admin Endpoints (Authentication Required)
- `GET /admin/` - Admin dashboard
- `GET /admin/static/*` - Admin static assets
- `GET /admin/rooms/` - Room management interface
- `GET /admin/rooms/roomdata/` - Room data API
- `GET /admin/items/` - Item management interface
- `GET /admin/items/itemdata/` - Item data API
- `GET /admin/mobs/` - Mob management interface
- `GET /admin/mobs/mobdata/` - Mob data API
- `GET /admin/races/` - Race management interface
- `GET /admin/races/racedata/` - Race data API
- `GET /admin/mutators/` - Mutator management interface
- `GET /admin/mutators/mutatordata/` - Mutator data API

## Performance Considerations

### Template Caching
- Templates are parsed on each request for development flexibility
- Include files (`_*.html`) are automatically discovered and loaded
- Plugin templates can override default behavior

### Authentication Caching
- Successful authentications cached for 30 minutes
- Reduces database load for frequent admin operations
- Automatic cache expiration and cleanup
- A cache hit still re-reads the user record every 30 s. `/admin/static/*` runs
  the middleware once per asset, so revalidation is rate-limited rather than
  done per request — that interval is the trade-off knob if admin page loads
  start feeling slow.

### Mutex Protection
- All admin operations protected by game state mutex
- Prevents concurrent modification of game data
- May cause brief delays during heavy admin usage

### Static File Serving
- Efficient static file serving for assets
- Proper MIME type detection and headers
- Directory listing protection

## Error Handling and Logging

### Request Logging
```go
// All requests logged with details
mudlog.Info("Web", 
    "ip", r.RemoteAddr,
    "ref", r.Header.Get("Referer"),
    "file path", fullPath,
    "file extension", fileExt,
    "file source", source,
    "size", fmt.Sprintf("%.2fk", float64(fSize)/1024)
)
```

### Error Responses
- Custom 404 error page with template processing
- Proper HTTP status codes for all error conditions
- Template parsing errors logged with full context
- Authentication failures logged with security details

        return p.renderDashboard(r)
    case "/myplugin/api/data":
        return p.handleAPIRequest(r)
    }
    return "", nil, false
}

func (p *MyPlugin) renderDashboard(r *http.Request) (string, map[string]any, bool) {
    html := `
    {{template "_header.html" .}}
    <h1>{{.PLUGIN_NAME}} Dashboard</h1>

        "PLUGIN_ITEMS": p.getPluginData(),
    }
    
    return html, data, true
}
```

This web system provides a robust foundation for both player-facing web interfaces and comprehensive administrative tools, with strong security, plugin extensibility, and real-time game integration capabilities.

Plugin-supplied pages (achievements, leaderboards, help) are **not** here —
modules register their own via `WebConfig.WebPage`, and this package serves
them through the plugin registry's `fs.ReadFileFS` implementation.

Note: filesystem-touching tests in this package chdir to the repo root and call
`configs.ReloadConfig()` — Go test binaries run with the CWD set to their own
package directory. `auth_test.go` is the precedent. **Because they share one
binary with everything else here, a test that depends on a balance knob must
pin it with `configs.SetConfigForTest` rather than read whatever is ambient.**
`admin_progression_test.go` is the precedent for that.

### `admin.progression.go` reads production, never a copy of it

Since U10b-0 Phase E the page calls
`characters.ProgressionChanceForStat` / `ProgressionChanceForSkill` at
`bonusMultiplier = 1.0`, and derives the dead-stat alarm from
`characters.ProgressionRollThreshold`. It previously hand-rolled bare
`CalculateProgressionChance`, which omitted `StatProgressionRate` and every
per-stat, per-skill, mutation and buff multiplier — that drift is why the page
could not surface the two sealed stats Phase B fixed. **Do not reintroduce a
local chance calculation here.**

`usesToReach` / `expectedRankForUses` invert the progression curve and replace
the retired `uses / UsesPerRank` division. Both **saturate** at the soft cap
once lifetime uses exceed the cost of reaching it, so Expected Rank is a triage
signal, not a measurement; the panel says so in full and the doc comments carry
the measured evidence.

`getStatBaseValue` (Base + Training) is deliberately local — there is no
`characters` equivalent — and `buildStatHealth` must keep using it rather than
`GetStatValue`. `StatInfo.Value` is `yaml:"-"` and `loadRecentUserFiles` never
calls `Recalculate()`, so `GetStatValue` reports 0 for every offline player.
