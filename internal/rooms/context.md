# Rooms Package Context

## Overview
The `internal/rooms` package is the core world management system for GoMud, handling all aspects of game world rooms, zones, and spatial relationships. It provides comprehensive room functionality including dynamic loading/unloading, ephemeral room creation, biome management, and complex room state tracking.

## Key Components

### Core Room Structure (`rooms.go`)
- **Room struct**: The main room entity containing all room data and state
- **Room properties**: Title, description, exits, items, NPCs, players, and environmental settings
- **Special room types**: Banks, storage rooms, character creation rooms, PvP areas
- **Dynamic state**: Player/mob tracking, visitor history, temporary data storage
- **Room features**: Containers, signs, skill training areas, spawn points

### Room Management System (`roommanager.go`)
- **RoomManager**: Singleton manager for all room operations and caching
- **Memory management**: Automatic loading/unloading of rooms based on occupancy
- **Zone management**: Organizing rooms into logical zones with metadata
- **File system integration**: Room data persistence and template loading
- **Cache optimization**: Room file path caching and efficient lookups

### Room Details and Presentation (`roomdetails.go`)
- **RoomTemplateDetails**: Rich room information for client rendering
- **Dynamic content**: Visible players, mobs, corpses, and exits
- **Environmental context**: Day/night cycles, lighting, biome effects
- **User-specific views**: Personalized room information based on character state
- **Room alerts**: Special notifications for banks, training, storage, etc.

### Biome System (`biomes.go`)
- **BiomeInfo**: Environmental definitions affecting room behavior
- **Lighting system**: Dark areas, lit areas, and visibility mechanics
- **Environmental effects**: Symbols, descriptions, and special properties
- **Item requirements**: Biomes that require specific items to navigate safely
- **Dynamic loading**: File-based biome definitions with validation

### Spawn Management (`spawninfo.go`)
- **SpawnInfo**: Comprehensive mob and item spawning system
- **Spawn configuration**: Mob templates, items, gold, and containers
- **Respawn mechanics**: Time-based respawning with configurable rates
- **Spawn customization**: Level modifications, hostility, scripting overrides
- **Quest integration**: Quest flags and buff assignments for spawned entities

### Container System (`container.go`)
- **Container**: In-room storage with locking mechanisms
- **Item management**: Adding, removing, and searching container contents
- **Lock system**: Difficulty-based locks requiring skills to open
- **Recipe system**: Crafting recipes that trigger when ingredients are present
- **Temporary containers**: Time-limited containers that despawn automatically
- **Hidden containers**: Optional `Hidden` bool field hides container until discovered via search
- **Discovery tracking**: Per-player tracking of which containers have been discovered

### Ephemeral Rooms (`ephemeral.go`)
- **Dynamic room creation**: Runtime creation of temporary room copies
- **Chunk management**: Efficient allocation of ephemeral room ID ranges
- **Memory optimization**: Automatic cleanup when rooms are no longer needed
- **Zone duplication**: Creating temporary copies of entire zones
- **ID mapping**: Tracking relationships between original and ephemeral rooms

### Zone Instance Options (`instances.go`)

`CreateZoneInstance` (legacy, existing callers unchanged) now delegates to:

```go
func CreateZoneInstanceWithOpts(
    zoneName      string,
    goldPaid      int,
    ownerUserId   int,
    authorizedUsers []int,
    overworldRoomId int,
    opts          ZoneInstanceOpts,
) (int, bool)
```

- Returns the ephemeral entry room ID and `true` on success.
- `ZoneInstanceOpts{SuppressReturnPortal bool}` — when `true`, the
  auto-added "return portal" exit is **not** created. Use this for
  confinement instances (e.g. instanced jail cells) where the occupant
  must not be able to walk out; lifetime is controlled by explicit
  teardown rather than portal expiry.
- `CreateZoneInstance(zoneName, goldPaid, ownerUserId, overworldRoomId)`
  passes a zero-value `ZoneInstanceOpts` (i.e. portal created as before),
  so all existing callers are unaffected.

**Confinement zones and `CheckPortalTimers`:**
A zone whose YAML sets `portal_duration: none` is **skipped** by
`CheckPortalTimers` — no TTL eviction and no "portal collapsing" warning
messages. This is the explicit "no-TTL" sentinel. Note that an **empty**
`portal_duration` field is auto-filled to `"30 real minutes"` by
`ZoneConfig.Validate()`, so omitting the field does NOT disable TTL —
you must set it to `none` explicitly. Such zones must be torn down
explicitly (e.g. via `TryEphemeralCleanup` called from the owning
subsystem's release/despawn path). The `instance_jail_cell` zone template
uses this pattern: its lifetime is owned entirely by `internal/justice`
(arrest creates, release or player-despawn destroys).

## Hidden Object Discovery System

### Overview
Rooms can contain hidden objects (containers, nouns) that are invisible until players discover them via the `search` skill. This system supports world-building secrets, optional exploration, and discovery-based puzzle elements.

### HiddenNoun Structure
```go
type HiddenNoun struct {
    Description       string // What `look <noun>` shows after discovery
    HiddenDescription string // Text appended to room description for discoverers
}
```

**Field meanings:**
- `Description` — Rich text shown when player runs `look <noun>` after finding it
- `HiddenDescription` — Flavor text appended to the room description when a discoverer enters the room (e.g., "You notice strange scratchmarks on the wall here.")
- No formal parent link; references to parent objects are pure prose (e.g., "gouged into the wooden wall")
- Hidden nouns are stored on `Room.HiddenNouns map[string]*HiddenNoun`
- Marked `instance:"skip"` in the YAML schema — always loaded from template, never overridden by instance saves

### Container Hidden Field
```go
type Container struct {
    // ... other fields ...
    Hidden bool // If true, container is invisible until discovered
}
```

**Behavior:**
- When `Hidden` is `true`, the container doesn't appear in room descriptions or `look` output
- After discovery via `search`, all players see the container in room details
- Discovery is tracked per-player in the character's discovery map
- The container noun in the room description should be subtly highlighted with `<ansi fg="itemname">noun</ansi>` for discoverability hints

### Authoring Convention
When writing hidden noun descriptions:
1. Reference parent objects in prose, not via formal links — e.g., "You see strange markings gouged into the **wooden wall**" rather than `parent: wall`
2. Keep `description` focused on the hidden object itself
3. Keep `hidden_description` brief (1-2 sentences) for room ambiance
4. Template-driven design: hidden nouns come from `rooms/zone/roomid.yaml`, not instance saves

## Key Features

### Dynamic World Management

### Spawn and Population
- **Flexible spawning**: Mobs, items, and gold with complex configuration
- **Respawn timing**: Configurable respawn rates and conditions
- **Population limits**: Preventing overcrowding through spawn management
- **Per-mob stat pools**: Mob difficulty set via `statpool` in mob YAML or per-spawn `statpool`/`statpoolmod` in room spawn info (zone-level autoscaling was removed in Phase 21)

### Performance Optimization
- **Chunk-based ephemeral rooms**: Efficient temporary room management
- **Lazy loading**: Rooms load only when needed
- **Memory cleanup**: Automatic removal of unused rooms and data

### Prose folding on template save

`SaveRoomTemplate` marshals through `marshalRoomTemplate` (`prose_wrap.go`), not
`yaml.Marshal` directly. Authored rooms wrap prose in folded (`>`) block
scalars; loading one joins its lines with spaces, so the in-memory value is a
single long line and yaml.v2 re-emits it as a literal (`|`) block holding one
enormous line. `marshalRoomTemplate` re-folds `description`, `nouns`,
`hidden_nouns` and `idlemessages` at 78 columns.

The binding constraint is round-trip fidelity: `load(save(room))` must return
the prose byte for byte. Only a folded scalar does that, and only with the right
chomping (`>` when the value carries a trailing newline, `>-` when it does not).
The code refuses to fold anything it cannot prove safe (interior newlines, runs
of spaces, tabs, leading/trailing spaces, tokens wider than the line) and
verifies the finished document by parsing it back, falling through to plain
yaml.v2 output on any doubt. It deliberately does NOT switch the whole marshal
to yaml.v3, which would re-indent every sequence in all 1386 room files.

### Instance saves vs. `instance:"skip"`

Room instance data in `rooms.instances/` **overlays** the YAML template on
load, so a stale instance save shadows template edits. The exception is fields
tagged `instance:"skip"`: `SaveRoomInstance` does not write them, and
`restoreSkipTaggedFields` (`save_and_load.go`) copies them back from the
template after the overlay is applied.

**`Room.SpawnInfo` is in that skip category** — a spawn-list edit takes effect
on the next room load with no wipe needed. Check the struct tag before assuming
a field is shadowed.

### Instance saves are two-phase (chunk 3.6b-1)

`SaveRoomInstance` no longer writes the file itself. It is now the synchronous
composition of two halves, and the split is what lets autosave stop freezing the
world:

- **`PrepareInstanceWrite(r Room) (savequeue.PendingWrite, error)`** does
  everything that reads live state: load the template, run the reflection diff,
  marshal. Returns immutable BYTES. Caller must hold the world lock.
- **`savequeue.Commit(p)`** does the durable write, or the delete when
  `p.Data == nil`. Touches nothing but the bytes and the path, so it can happen
  later, on a different tick.

3.6a measured the write as 95.3% of a dirty room's save cost, which is why the
split is worth having: only prepare stays under the lock. Measured after:
1000 fully-dirty rooms went from 5980 ms to 120 ms of lock-held cost.

`SaveRoomInstance` still exists and still means "save this room NOW and tell me
if it failed", because unload, the builder, shutdown and copyover all need that.

**A prepared write must be CANCELLED by anything that takes ownership of the
file** (guard G2), and that set is larger than "everything that calls
`SaveRoomInstance`". These three delete room data directly and each cancels:

| Path | Why it bypasses the save function |
|---|---|
| `ClearRoomCache` | drops the room from memory with no save at all |
| `DeleteRoomTemplate` | `os.Remove`s the template |
| `DeleteZone` | `os.RemoveAll`s `rooms.instances/<zone>/` wholesale |

`DeleteZone` cancels from its `doomed` list BEFORE the removal, for the same
reason that list exists: once the directories are gone, `LoadRoomTemplate` reads
from disk and returns nil for every one of those rooms.

**`LoadRoomTemplate` is uncached** — a disk read and YAML parse per call, and
`PrepareInstanceWrite` calls it per room per autosave cycle. That is roughly
64% of what prepare costs. Template caching is a known separate slice; until it
lands, prepare cost tracks file I/O rather than CPU.

### `Room.DefusedExits` — persisting a disarm without shadowing

`Room.Exits` is skip-tagged, which meant a player disarming an exit lock trap
saw the trap return on the next restart (`Room.Containers` is *not*
skip-tagged, so the container branch of the same `defuse` command persisted
correctly — two branches of one command with opposite guarantees).

`DefusedExits []string` is the narrow escape hatch: a list of exit **names**
only, not skip-tagged, so it round-trips through the instance save.
`(*Room).MarkExitTrapDefused(name)` clears the live trap and records the name;
`(*Room).applyDefusedExits()` re-clears them in `LoadRoomInstance` **after**
`restoreSkipTaggedFields` has rebuilt `Exits` from the template.

This cannot reintroduce shadowing: every exit property — destination, lock
difficulty, exit message, oneway/secret — is still sourced wholly from the
template on each load. The instance file cannot add, remove or redirect an
exit; its only power is to clear `Lock.TrapBuffIds` on an exit the template
already defines, and a name that no longer matches an authored exit is a
silent no-op. Do **not** "simplify" this by removing the `instance:"skip"` tag
from `Exits`.

## Dependencies

- Environmental effects through biome integration
- Temporary content through ephemeral room system

## Testing
Comprehensive test coverage in `*_test.go` files covering:
- Room loading and caching mechanisms
- Spawn system functionality
- Container and lock mechanics
- Ephemeral room creation and cleanup
- Visitor tracking and room state management

## Special Considerations
- **Memory management**: Rooms automatically unload when empty to conserve memory
- **Ephemeral limits**: Maximum of 100 chunks with 250 rooms each for temporary content
- **Thread safety**: Room operations are designed for concurrent access
- **Data persistence**: Room changes are automatically saved to maintain world state

This package serves as the foundation for the entire game world, providing a rich and dynamic environment system that supports complex gameplay mechanics while maintaining optimal performance through intelligent memory management.
