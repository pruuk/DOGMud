# Justice Package Context

## Purpose / Overview

`internal/justice` is the town-justice substrate: it decides whether a
player is "wanted" by a faction's guards (`Verdict`), runs the per-round
guard enforcement tick (`RunGuardEnforcement`), auto-posts faction
kill-bounties at crime sites (`MaybeDeclareBounty`), and executes the
full arrest/jail lifecycle (`ExecuteArrest`, `ResolveDetention`).

The verdict logic is deliberately pure and self-contained so that the
same decision function can be reused by future bounty-hunter NPCs (5.2)
without pulling guard enforcement along.

---

## Key Files

### `justice.go` — Severity enum + `Verdict`

Defines the `Severity` ordered enum:

```go
type Severity int

const (
    SeverityNone   Severity = iota // citizen / not wanted
    SeverityWarn                   // wanted, mild — verbal warning
    SeverityArrest                 // wanted, arrest-level
    SeverityAttack                 // wanted, severe — engage on sight
)
```

**Ordering matters** — callers compare with `>` to find the worst signal.
`SeverityAttack` is never produced by `Verdict`; it is only emitted by
`RunGuardEnforcement` when the resist fork fires (see enforce.go).

`Verdict(guardFactions []string, userId int) Severity` is the pure
decision function:
- Builds the full faction set (guard factions + their declared allies).
- Returns `SeverityArrest` if the player has any open faction bounty,
  any Hostile rep tier, or any unresolved crime within the lookback
  window.
- Returns `SeverityWarn` if the player has a Cold rep tier with any
  faction in the set.
- Returns `SeverityNone` otherwise.

Config knob: `JusticeCrimeLookbackRounds` (default 1000 if unset).

Read seams (`repTierFn`, `alliesFn`, `openFactionBountyFn`,
`unresolvedCrimeFn`, `nowRoundFn`, `lookbackFn`) are package-level
function vars; tests override them to avoid standing up live faction/
bounty/crimes stacks.

---

### `enforce.go` — Guard enforcement tick + speech seam

`RunGuardEnforcement(mob *mobs.Mob, room *rooms.Room, nowRound uint64) []EnforceAction`

Called once per round from `internal/hooks/NewRound_MobRoundTick.go` for
every `guard`-group mob. Skips mobs already in combat or charmed, and
players who are hidden, dead, or aggro-flagged immune.

**Three-branch dispatch on `Verdict` result:**

| Verdict | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| `SeverityAttack` | `mob.Command("attack @uid")` immediately |
| `SeverityWarn` | On first sight: `guardSayFn` + stamp `justice_warned_<uid>` in guard MiscData. After `GuardWarnGraceRounds` elapse: escalate to attack |
| `SeverityArrest` | Fork on player's `ArrestPolicy` (see below) |

**Arrest branch** (`SeverityArrest`, from pure helper `resolveArrest`):

| Player policy | Outcome |
|---------------|---------|
| Resist | `mob.Command("attack @uid")` immediately — `SeverityAttack` action emitted |
| Surrender, no live stamp | `guardSayFn` declaration; stamp `justice_arrest_pending_round` and `justice_arrest_pending_room` on the PLAYER's MiscData, so one guard speaks however many share the room (#241) |
| Surrender, within `ArrestResistGraceRounds` | No-op (waiting) |
| Surrender, grace run, same room | Any guard there calls `executeArrestFn` (→ `ExecuteArrest`) and clears the stamp |
| Surrender, player walked out of the declared room | `LapseArrestStampOnMove` (a `RoomChange` listener wired in `hooks.RegisterListeners`) drops the stamp, so the next sighting declares afresh, even back in the same room inside the window |
| Surrender, stamp from another room or older than twice the grace | `liveArrestStamp` drops it; this sighting declares afresh |

`LapseArrestStampOnMove` clears only on a move whose `FromRoomId` is the
stamped room: the `RoomChange` for the player's own arrival can be heard
after a guard there has declared, and must not drop that fresh stamp.

The `EnforceAction` return value carries `{UserId, Severity, Escalated}`
for tests and future telemetry.

**`guardSayFn` seam**: The package-level var `guardSayFn` is a no-op by
default. `internal/hooks/justice_wiring.go` installs the real broadcaster
at `init()` via `justice.SetGuardSay(fn)`. This keeps `justice` free of
`internal/actions` imports, breaking the import cycle that would otherwise
arise because crime sites in `internal/actions` call `MaybeDeclareBounty`.

**`executeArrestFn` seam**: Wraps `ExecuteArrest`; tests override to
intercept without a live mob/world.

**`guardFactionsFn` seam**: `factions.FactionsForMob`, which needs loaded
faction definitions; tests override it.

**`firstFactionWithCell`**: When a guard belongs to multiple factions
(e.g. `guards` + `citizens`), `firstFactionWithCell(guardFactions)` picks
the first one that owns a holding cell via `cellRoomFn`. Used in the
`arrestOutcomeHaul` branch so the correct arresting faction (and its cell)
is selected; returns `""` if no faction owns a cell, which aborts the haul
silently and leaves the player's stamp to lapse on its own.

**`pruneStaleWarnStamps`**: Called once per guard-tick at the top of
`RunGuardEnforcement`. Deletes `justice_warned_<uid>` entries older than
`warnStampStaleAfter()` rounds (delegates to `lookbackFn` —
`JusticeCrimeLookbackRounds`). Warn stamps are written on first Cold-rep
sighting but never cleared once rep recovers; without this sweep they
accumulate on guard MiscData indefinitely. It also deletes any leftover
per-guard `justice_arrest_pending_*` key. Arrest stamps live on the
player, not the guard, and lapse on their own (`liveArrestStamp`,
`LapseArrestStampOnMove`, #241). The stamp is shared across factions (a
guard of another faction in the same room may haul on it) and is cleared on
logout (`LapseArrestStampOnDespawn`, a `PlayerDespawn` listener).

---

### `bounty.go` — Auto-bounty declaration

`MaybeDeclareBounty(faction string, userId int, triggerKind crimes.Kind)`

Posts a faction kill-bounty on the player when warranted. Idempotent per
(faction, player): skips if an open faction bounty already exists.

Declares on an identified murder (`crimes.KindMurder`) OR Hostile rep
tier — same two signals that produce `SeverityArrest` in `Verdict`.

**Fine/bounty gold formula** (`bountyGold`, pure):
```
gold = powerBase × max(crimeMult, repMult)
```
- `powerBase` = `bounties.DefaultGoldFor(PlayerSubject(userId))`
- `crimeMult` = `JusticeBountyMurderMult` on murder, else 1.0
- `repMult` ramps 1.0 (rep −50, Hostile floor) → `JusticeBountyRepMultMax`
  (rep −100); 1.0 if not yet Hostile

Config knobs: `JusticeBountyExpiryRounds` (default 5000),
`JusticeBountyMurderMult`, `JusticeBountyRepMultMax`.

**Where it is called:**
- `internal/hooks/MobDeath_FactionRep` (identified murder)
- `internal/actions/attack.go` (assault rep hit)
- `internal/actions/steal.go` and `internal/actions/plant.go` (theft)

All seams (`bDefaultGoldFn`, `bRepFn`, `bTierFn`, `bDeclareFn`,
`bExistingFn`, `bExpiryRoundsFn`, `bMurderMultFn`, `bRepMultMaxFn`,
`bNowFn`) are package-level function vars.

---

### `arrest.go` — Jail lifecycle

Holds the fine math, the jail record type, and the two public lifecycle
functions. Does NOT import `internal/actions` or `internal/usercommands`;
player messages go through `users.GetByUserId(uid).SendText` directly.

**MiscData jail record keys** (stamped on `characters.Character`):

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|
| `jail_until_round` | uint64 | Round when sentence expires |
| `jail_fine_original` | int | Fine at time of arrest |
| `jail_decay_per_round` | int | Gold deducted per round served |
| `jail_faction` | string | Arresting faction slug |
| `jail_cell_room` | int | Holding-cell room ID (static fallback; 0 if instanced) |
| `jail_crime_ids` | string | Comma-separated unresolved crime IDs |
| `jail_instance_id` | int | Ephemeral zone-instance ID (0 = static cell) |

**Holding-cell registry**: Cell room IDs live on the faction definition
YAML as a `holding_cell_room:` field (`factions.Definition.HoldingCellRoom`),
read via the `cellRoomFn` seam in `justice.go`. `ExecuteArrest` returns
`false` (no-op) for factions whose `holding_cell_room` is 0 (absent/omitted).
Current cells: `thornwall_guards` → 5105, `stillwater_guards` → 5106.
These rooms are retained only as the **static fallback** for when instance
creation fails (see Instanced Jail Cells below).

**Release-room registry**: Release room IDs live on the faction definition
YAML as a `release_room:` field (`factions.Definition.ReleaseRoom`), read
via the `releaseRoomFn` seam in `justice.go`. `ResolveDetention` uses the
per-faction release room when non-zero, falling back to the hardcoded
`barracksRoomId` (473) for factions that define none. Current values:
`thornwall_guards` → 473, `stillwater_guards` → 4110. Boot-time validation
panics on a dangling release_room (same `ValidateHoldingCells` call, see
`internal/factions/registry.go`).

Boot-time validation (`factions.ValidateHoldingCells`, called from main.go
after `rooms.LoadDataFiles()`) panics if any faction's `holding_cell_room`
references a room that doesn't exist. DI callback (`func(int) bool`)
breaks the factions ← rooms import cycle.

**`JailRecord` struct** (exported for commands):
```go
type JailRecord struct {
    FineOriginal  int
    DecayPerRound int
    UntilRound    uint64
    Faction       string
    CellRoom      int
    InstanceId    int  // 0 = static cell / not instanced
}
```

`JailInfo(player *characters.Character) (JailRecord, bool)` — accessor
used by the `fine` command to compute the current decaying fine.

**`computeFine`** reuses `bountyGold` (same formula as auto-bounty gold)
so the fine is proportional to the bounty the player attracted.

**`sentenceRounds(fine, decayPerRound int) int`** — `fine / decay`, min 1.

**`currentFine(original, roundsServed, decayPerRound int) int`** — pure
decay math; floors at zero.

#### `ExecuteArrest(player *characters.Character, userId int, faction string, isMurder bool) bool`

1. Attempts to create a per-prisoner instanced cell via `aCreateCellFn`
   (see Instanced Jail Cells below). On success, uses the ephemeral entry
   room and stores the instance ID in `jail_instance_id`.
2. Falls back to the faction's static `cellRoomFn` (HoldingCellRoom) if
   instance creation fails. Returns `false` if neither path yields a cell.
3. Computes fine + sentence rounds.
4. Collects unresolved crime IDs for the faction via
   `crimeIdsForFactionPlayer`.
5. Stamps all jail MiscData keys (including `jail_instance_id`).
6. Applies condition 88 (Jailed) via `player.AddConditionScaled(88, float64(rounds))`
   — `TriggersLeft` is scaled to `rounds` so the condition expires naturally
   at sentence end.
7. `player.EndAggro()` — drops any fight the player was in (they are in
   custody now, not brawling).
8. Moves the player to the cell via `rooms.MoveToRoom`.
9. Sends arrest-flavor text to the player.

The Jailed condition (id 88) carries two flags: `no-go` / `NoMovement` prevents
walking, fleeing, and recalling out (see flee.go + spell_foldrecall.go);
`no-aggro-target` makes the jailed player invisible to all mob aggro
targeting, so guards do not pursue prisoners into the cell. The combat
round (`hooks/NewRound_DoCombat.go`) also drops a mob's stale aggro on a
`no-aggro-target` player. The condition's `end_actee` ("The cell door swings
open. You are free to go.") fires automatically when the condition is removed —
this is the single release line for both the timer and pay-fine paths, so
`ResolveDetention` does NOT send its own.

#### `ClearFactionRecord(faction string, userId int)`

Exported helper shared by **two** callers:
- `ResolveDetention` — called when a player serves a sentence or pays a
  fine (detention ends).
- `internal/hooks/PlayerDeath_BountyResolve` — called in the `killGuard`
  branch when a bounty-hunter mob claims a wanted player's death (5.2).
  Death pays the debt in the same way as serving a sentence.

Clears the player's standing with the given faction and all its declared
allies: resolves unresolved crimes, withdraws open faction bounties, and
resets rep to `JusticeArrestRepReset` floor where currently below it.

#### `ResolveDetention(player *characters.Character, userId int) bool`

Ends detention on timer expiry or fine payment. Crucially, it clears the
player's record across the arresting faction **and its declared allies**
(the same set `Verdict` checks) — guards belong to `thornwall_guards` AND
`thornwall_citizens`, so clearing only one would leave an unresolved crime
against the other that re-triggers arrest the instant the player is freed.
1. Guards on `jail_until_round` presence; returns `false` if not jailed.
2. Builds the faction set (arresting faction + `alliesFn`). For each
   faction, live-queries `aCrimesForFactionFn` and resolves every
   unresolved crime by that player via `crimes.Resolve(f, id, "served
   sentence")`.
3. Withdraws all open bounties issued by any faction in the set.
4. Resets rep to `JusticeArrestRepReset` floor for each faction in the set,
   only where currently below it (default −10; never lowers good standing).
5. Removes condition 88 via `player.RemoveCondition(88)` — this fires the condition's
   release line; `ResolveDetention` sends no flavor of its own.
6. When `InstanceId != 0`, tears down the ephemeral cell via
   `aTeardownCellFn` (registry Remove + `rooms.TryEphemeralCleanup`)
   before moving the player. Static-cell prisoners (`InstanceId == 0`)
   are simply teleported without any teardown.
7. Clears all jail MiscData keys.
8. Moves player to the per-faction release room (via `releaseRoomFn`),
   falling back to `barracksRoomId` (473) if the faction defines none.

Release seams: `aResolveCrimeFn`, `aCrimesForFactionFn`, `alliesFn`,
`aOpenBountiesFn`, `aWithdrawFn`, `aGetRepFn`, `aSetRepFn`, `aMoveFn`,
`aDecayFn`, `aRepResetFn`, `releaseRoomFn`.

---

### Instanced Jail Cells

Each arrest creates a **private ephemeral jail cell** owned by a single
prisoner, rather than placing all prisoners in a shared static room.

#### Creation seam — `aCreateCellFn`

```go
var aCreateCellFn = func(prisonerUserId, releaseRoomId int) (int, bool)
```

The default implementation calls:
```go
rooms.CreateZoneInstanceWithOpts(
    "Instance Jail Cell", 1, prisoner, []int{prisoner},
    releaseRoom,
    rooms.ZoneInstanceOpts{SuppressReturnPortal: true},
)
```

Returns the ephemeral entry room ID and `true` on success. The zone
template (`instance_jail_cell/5107.yaml`) is a plain stone cell; the
description is patched at arrest time via `aSetCellDescFn` (see below).

`SuppressReturnPortal: true` ensures no "return portal" exit is added to
the ephemeral room — the prisoner cannot walk out; release is only via
`ResolveDetention`.

The zone sets `portal_duration: none`, so `CheckPortalTimers` skips it
entirely — no TTL eviction or "portal collapsing" warnings. (An empty
`portal_duration` would be auto-filled to `"30 real minutes"` by
`ZoneConfig.Validate()` — the explicit `none` sentinel is required.) Cell
lifetime is owned by explicit teardown on release or despawn.

On failure, `ExecuteArrest` falls back to the faction's static
`HoldingCellRoom`. If that is also 0, the arrest is silently aborted.

#### Description seam — `aSetCellDescFn`

```go
var aSetCellDescFn = func(roomId int, desc string)
```

Mutates the ephemeral cell room's `Description` to faction-appropriate
prose. The caller builds the description text via `factionCellDescription(faction)`
and passes the result so it stays in sync with the `instance_jail_cell/5107.yaml`
template room's own text.

#### Teardown seam — `aTeardownCellFn`

```go
var aTeardownCellFn = func(entryRoomId int)
```

Called by both `ResolveDetention` (release) and `HandleJailedDespawn`
(logout) when `InstanceId != 0`. Removes the zone from the instance
registry and calls `rooms.TryEphemeralCleanup` to reclaim the ephemeral
ID range.

#### Logout / despawn — `HandleJailedDespawn(player *characters.Character)`

Called from the `PlayerDespawn_JailCleanup` hook when a jailed player
disconnects:

1. Tears down the ephemeral cell (`aTeardownCellFn`) to free the room ID.
2. **Keeps the jail record intact** — the absolute `UntilRound` sentence
   clock persists on the character so time continues to tick offline.
3. Rewrites `jail_cell_room` to the faction's static fallback cell and
   clears `jail_instance_id` so the character never loads into a dead
   ephemeral room on the next login.

The character's saved `RoomId` is also set to the static fallback, which
is what the engine reads when the player next connects.

#### Login restore — `RestoreJailOnLogin(player, userId)`

Called from `PlayerSpawn_HandleJoin` (login hook) for any character whose
jail record has a non-zero `UntilRound`:

- **Sentence already served** (offline time ≥ `UntilRound`): calls
  `ResolveDetention` immediately — the player is released on connect.
- **Sentence still running**: creates a fresh ephemeral cell via
  `aCreateCellFn`, refreshes condition 88 to the **remaining** rounds
  (`UntilRound - nowRound`), applies `aSetCellDescFn`, and moves the
  player inside. This path handles both normal logout/login and server
  restarts (all ephemeral instances vanish on boot; `UntilRound` on the
  character YAML is the authoritative clock).

`RestoreJailOnLogin` is the single authoritative placement point for
returning prisoners; no other login path touches cell assignment.

## Cross-Package Wiring

| Caller / site | What it calls |
|---------------|---------------|
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_MobRoundTick.go` | `RunGuardEnforcement` (guard-group mobs) |
| `internal/hooks/Jail_ExpiryRelease.go` | `JailInfo`, `ResolveDetention` (per-player tick) |
| `internal/hooks/PlayerDeath_BountyResolve.go` | `ClearFactionRecord` (5.2: hunter kill clears the record, same as serving a sentence); `bounties.Withdraw` (on wanted player's death via other paths) |
| `internal/hooks/PlayerDespawn_JailCleanup.go` | `HandleJailedDespawn` — tears down ephemeral cell on logout, preserves `UntilRound` |
| `internal/hooks/PlayerSpawn_HandleJoin.go` | `RestoreJailOnLogin` — re-creates cell or releases on reconnect/server restart |
| `internal/hooks/justice_wiring.go` | `justice.SetGuardSay(fn)` at init |
| `internal/hooks/MobDeath_FactionRep.go` | `MaybeDeclareBounty` (murder) |
| `internal/actions/attack.go` | `MaybeDeclareBounty` (assault) |
| `internal/actions/steal.go`, `plant.go` | `MaybeDeclareBounty` (theft) |
| `internal/usercommands/jail.go` | `JailInfo`, `ResolveDetention` (fine/payfine) |
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_DoCombat.go` | drops a mob's stale aggro on a `no-aggro-target` (jailed) player — no `justice` call, but part of the jail-lockdown contract |

`justice` itself imports only: `bounties`, `configs`, `crimes`,
`factions`, `knowledge`, `opinions`, `util`, `characters`, `rooms`,
`mobs`, `users`, `messaging`. It never imports `internal/actions` or
`internal/usercommands`.

---

## Test Seam Convention

All external calls (faction rep, crime lookups, bounty queries, room
moves, etc.) are wrapped in package-level `var` function pointers with
descriptive names (e.g. `repTierFn`, `executeArrestFn`, `aMoveFn`).
Tests replace these vars with stubs that return controlled values without
standing up live subsystems. Production never sets them; the zero-value
wires to the real implementation.

Test files: `justice_test.go`, `enforce_test.go`, `bounty_test.go`,
`arrest_test.go`.

---

## Config Knobs (Balance)

| Knob | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `JusticeCrimeLookbackRounds` | 1000 | How far back unresolved crimes count toward Verdict |
| `GuardWarnGraceRounds` | 50 | Rounds a Warn-severity player has before escalation to attack |
| `ArrestResistGraceRounds` | 3 | Rounds a guard waits after declaring arrest before hauling |
| `JusticeFineDecayPerRound` | 5 | Gold the fine drops per served round |
| `JusticeArrestRepReset` | -10 | Rep floor restored to on release (only if below) |
| `JusticeBountyExpiryRounds` | 5000 | TTL on auto-declared faction bounties |
| `JusticeBountyMurderMult` | — | Fine/bounty multiplier for murder |
| `JusticeBountyRepMultMax` | — | Max rep-based multiplier at rep -100 |

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `justice.go` | Crime recording and the justice entry points |
| `enforce.go` | Guard response and enforcement |
| `arrest.go` | Arrest flow |
| `bounty.go` | Bounty accrual |

Crime and reputation state is runtime-generated (`factions.crimes`,
`factions.rep`) and gitignored — it is living state, not instance data.
