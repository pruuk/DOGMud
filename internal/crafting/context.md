# Crafting Package Context

## Overview

The `internal/crafting` package implements the data-driven recipe and
crafting framework (Stage 13.1), the corpse-salvage lookup table
(cooking supply chain, chunk 5.4), and the enchanting-mat salvage
mapping (enchanting supply chain, chunk 5.4). It is a pure-logic
package: it owns no persistent state and emits no side effects —
callers in `internal/usercommands/` and `internal/hooks/` drive the
actual item transfers and player messaging.

Three distinct systems live here:

1. **Recipe crafting** — players and NPC crafters combine tagged
   ingredients at optional stations to produce output items.
2. **Corpse salvage** — salvaging a mob corpse yields materials
   determined by the mob's group membership (rodent → wild-hare-meat;
   animal → raw-meat; humanoid → cloth/leather).
3. **Enchant salvage mapping** — salvaging a spoiled/decayed potion
   yields enchanting materials; the tier of materials is keyed by the
   source potion's alchemy-recipe `skill_minimum`.

The corpse-salvage system feeds the cooking supply chain: foragers
salvage animal/rodent corpses, the yielded meat flows into forager
lockboxes, and `BackfillVendorFromChests` (in `internal/forager/`)
drains those chests into cook-vendor stock.

## Key Components

### Core Files

- **crafting.go** — `RecipeSpec` struct + `fileloader.Loadable`
  implementation; `LoadRecipes`, `GetRecipe`, `GetRecipesForSkill`,
  ingredient/output access helpers.
- **validation.go** — `ValidateRecipe` checks ingredient tags against
  the item registry; called at load time and by integration tests.
- **difficulty.go** — the craft/salvage CONTEST (U10b-1b): `CraftScore`,
  `CraftDifficulty`, `CraftPrimaryStat`, `DearestMaterialTier`,
  `SalvageDifficulty`, `FallbackSalvageDifficulty`, and the two floor
  seams `RunCraftContest` / `RunSalvageContest`.
- **salvage.go** — `CalcSalvageRounds` (duration from ingredient gold
  value), `RollSalvageReturns` / `RollSalvageReturnsFromSpec` (per-unit
  CONTEST over an ingredient list).
- **corpse_salvage.go** — static `corpseSalvageTable` + public
  `LookupCorpseSalvage(groups []string) []items.SalvageReturn`.
- **enchant_salvage_map.go** — `EnchantSalvageYield` /
  `EnchantSalvageYieldWith`; tiered potion→enchanting-mat mapping
  keyed by recipe `skill_minimum` (see below).
- **crafting_test.go** — recipe-load + GetRecipe unit tests.
- **salvage_test.go** — CalcSalvageRounds / RollSalvageReturns unit tests.
- **difficulty_test.go** — the anchor, the mastery curve against the
  spec's table, tier determinism, and the SkillWeight/CraftSkillMinWeight
  coupling guard.
- **corpse_salvage_test.go** — LookupCorpseSalvage unit tests
  covering each table entry + no-match + first-entry-wins ordering.
- **enchant_salvage_map_test.go** — `EnchantSalvageYieldWith` table-
  driven tests covering each band boundary, roll hits/misses, the
  band-4 all-miss binding-paste floor, and the `qtyBonus` path.
- **validation_test.go** — ValidateRecipe unit tests.
- **integration_crafting_test.go** — end-to-end recipe-load
  integration test (loads YAML from disk).
- **test_main_test.go** — test-binary setup (data-file path
  initialization).

## Key Functions

### Recipe Crafting

- **`LoadRecipes(dir string) error`** — walks `dir` recursively,
  loads all `*.yaml` recipe files, validates each, populates the
  in-process registry. Called from `main.go` at startup.
- **`GetRecipe(id string) (*RecipeSpec, bool)`** — look up a recipe
  by its string id.
- **`GetRecipesForSkill(skill string) []*RecipeSpec`** — return all
  recipes belonging to a skill tag (e.g., `"cooking"`), sorted by
  name for stable UI ordering.

### Salvage Math

🔴 **`CalcSalvageChance` and `CalcSuccessChance` were DELETED by U10b-1b.**
Craft and salvage are contests now, not flat percentages. The knobs that
fed them (`SalvageMinChance`, `SalvageMaxChance`, `SalvageSoftCap`,
`CraftingBaseSuccessChance`, `CraftingSkillBonusPerLevel`,
`CraftingMin/MaxSuccessChance`) still exist in config and are still
validated, but **decide nothing** — do not pin them in a test expecting
an outcome.

- **`CraftScore(stat, skillLevel)`** — `stat + skill × SkillWeight`, the
  standard composition. `stat` is the DISCIPLINE'S primary, which varies:
  blacksmithing STRENGTH, alchemy/cooking/enchanting PERCEPTION,
  tailoring/jewelcrafting DEXTERITY. Use `CraftPrimaryStat(recipe)`.
- **`CraftDifficulty(skillMinimum, materialTierMult)`** —
  `(CraftBaseDifficulty + skillMinimum × CraftSkillMinWeight) × tierMult`.
  ⚠️ The 50/50 anchor holds only while `SkillWeight == CraftSkillMinWeight`;
  there is a guard test for that coupling.
- **`DearestMaterialTier(consumed []items.Item)`** — max `MaterialTier`
  over the CONCRETE items being spent. 🔴 Never resolve by
  `component_tag`: `items.FindSpecByComponentTag` iterates a Go map and
  four items share the tag `bottle`.
- **`SelectIngredients(inv, componentInv, recipe)`** (crafting.go) — the
  items `ConsumeIngredients` would take, in the same order (component bag
  first). That ordering IS the bottle tiebreak.
- **`RunCraftContest` / `RunSalvageContest`** — the ONLY readers of
  `CraftFloor` / `SalvageFloor`. Call these, never `contest.RunWithFloors`
  directly, so a site cannot be handed the wrong floor.
- **`SalvageDifficulty(itemId, tierMult)`** — the item's own craft
  difficulty; `ok=false` when it has no recipe.
- **`CalcSalvageRounds(totalGoldValue, goldPerRound, maxRounds)`** —
  duration = `max(1, min(maxRounds, goldValue / goldPerRound))`.
- **`RollSalvageReturns(ingredients, score, difficulty)`** — one contest
  per unit; returns only recovered items.

### Enchant Salvage Mapping

- **`EnchantSalvageYieldWith(skillMin int, roll func() float64, qtyBonus int, b EnchantSalvageBands) []RecipeIngredient`**
  — pure, testable core. Maps a potion's recipe `skill_minimum` to a
  slice of `RecipeIngredient` (item tags + quantities) using four
  bands:

  | Band | `skillMin` threshold | Guaranteed output | Possible extras |
  |------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
  | 1    | < `Band2Min` (10)    | binding-paste ×(1+bonus) | — |
  | 2    | ≥ 10                 | binding-paste ×(1+bonus) | chrysalis-setting (25%) |
  | 3    | ≥ 18                 | binding-paste ×(1+bonus) | chrysalis-setting (35%), mutation-catalyst (12%) |
  | 4    | ≥ 28                 | binding-paste fallback if all miss | mutation-catalyst (40%), chrysalis-setting (30%), chrysalis-core (8%) |

  Band 4 rolls each rare mat independently; if every roll misses the
  function still returns one binding-paste (the guaranteed floor).
  `qtyBonus` (0+) increases the binding-paste quantity in bands 1-3;
  pass 0 when the NPC decay path calls it, non-zero for a skilled
  player salvage bonus.

- **`EnchantSalvageYield(potionItemId int, roll func() float64, qtyBonus int) []RecipeIngredient`**
  — live wrapper. Resolves the potion item ID to its alchemy-recipe
  `skill_minimum` via `GetRecipeByOutputItemId`; falls back to 0
  (band 1) for unknown/no-recipe potions. Reads band thresholds and
  percentages from `configs.GetBalanceConfig()`. Delegates to
  `EnchantSalvageYieldWith`.

  Config knobs (all in `Balance`, with defaults):
  - `EnchantSalvageBand2Min` (10), `Band3Min` (18), `Band4Min` (28)
  - `EnchantSalvageBand2SettingPct` (25)
  - `EnchantSalvageBand3SettingPct` (35), `Band3CatalystPct` (12)
  - `EnchantSalvageBand4CatalystPct` (40), `Band4SettingPct` (30),
    `Band4CorePct` (8)

  **Shared callers.** The same function drives two paths:
  1. *Player spoiled-potion salvage* — `usercommands/salvage.go` calls
     it when the target corpse is a potion item.
  2. *NPC alchemy-decay loop* — the shop restock hook
     (`hooks/MobIdle_HandleIdleMobs.go`) iterates `DecayedUnit` slices
     returned by `shops.TickOverstockDecay`; for each decayed potion
     it calls `EnchantSalvageYield` and routes the resulting mats into
     the `shops.AddToReserve` global pool. Enchanters then draw from
     that pool on their idle tick via `shops.SelectStockTransfers`.

### Corpse Salvage

- **`LookupCorpseSalvage(groups []string) []items.SalvageReturn`** —
  scans `corpseSalvageTable` in declaration order; returns the
  `Returns` slice of the first entry whose `Group` string appears in
  the mob's groups list. Returns `nil` when no entry matches (e.g.,
  elementals, chrysalis mobs).

  Table order (specific before broad):

  | Group | Yields |
  |-------|--------|
  | `rodent` | wild-hare-meat ×1, leather-strip ×1 |
  | `animal` | raw-meat ×1, leather-strip ×2, sinew ×1 |
  | `humanoid` | cloth-strip ×2, leather-strip ×1 |

  To add a new mob category, prepend its entry before `animal` if it
  should take priority over the generic-animal row, or append after
  `humanoid` for unmatchable fallbacks. The `rodent` entry sits before
  `animal` so small-game mobs with both groups match the narrow row.

## Global State

- **`recipeRegistry map[string]*RecipeSpec`** — in-process map keyed
  by `RecipeSpec.RecipeId`; populated at startup by `LoadRecipes`.
  Read-only after load; no mutex needed.
- **`corpseSalvageTable []corpseSalvageEntry`** — package-level
  slice; declared statically in `corpse_salvage.go`, never mutated
  at runtime.
- **`EnchantSalvageBands`** — plain Go struct (no package-level
  state); constructed on each call to `EnchantSalvageYield` from the
  live balance config. No mutex needed; all state is stack-local.

## Data Structure Design

### RecipeSpec (YAML)

```yaml
id: grilled-meat
name: Grilled Meat
skill: cooking
skill_minimum: 0
station: ""          # "" = no station required
time_rounds: 2
ingredients:
  - item_tag: raw-meat
    quantity: 1
output:
  item_id: 40060
  quantity: 1
success_message: "You grill the meat over the fire."
failure_message: ""
```

Optional enchanting fields: `target_type`, `enchant_type`.

### corpseSalvageEntry (Go struct, not YAML)

```go
type corpseSalvageEntry struct {
    Group   string
    Returns []items.SalvageReturn  // {ItemTag string, Quantity int}
}
```

## Integration Notes

**Consumers of recipe crafting:**
- `internal/usercommands/craft.go` — player `craft` command; calls
  `GetRecipe`, resolves ingredients from backpack + equipped items,
  drives the multi-round activity, calls `RollSalvageReturns` for
  salvage recipes.
- `internal/hooks/TickMobCraft*.go` — NPC crafter tick; calls
  `GetRecipesForSkill` to pick recipes, manufactures items into the
  NPC's shop stock.

**Consumers of corpse salvage:**
- `internal/usercommands/salvage.go` — player `salvage <corpse>`
  command; calls `LookupCorpseSalvage(mob.Groups)`, then
  `RollSalvageReturns`.
- `internal/actions/salvage.go` — shared `actions.Salvage` called by
  both player and mob salvage paths; same lookup chain.

**Consumers of enchant salvage mapping:**
- `internal/usercommands/salvage.go` — when the salvaged target is a
  potion item, calls `EnchantSalvageYield` to determine mat returns.
- `internal/hooks/MobIdle_HandleIdleMobs.go` — the shop restock hook
  iterates `[]shops.DecayedUnit` returned by `shops.TickOverstockDecay`
  for alchemy-vendor mobs (Ilsa's, Voss's); for each decayed potion it
  calls `EnchantSalvageYield` and feeds results into
  `shops.AddToReserve`.

**Upstream dependencies:**
- `internal/items` — `SalvageReturn`, `ItemSpec`, `component_tag`
  resolution.
- `internal/fileloader` — generic YAML walker used by `LoadRecipes`.
- `internal/configs` — balance knobs read by callers (not by this
  package directly).

## Testing Notes

- All pure-math functions (`CalcSalvageRounds`, the difficulty.go helpers,
  `RollSalvageReturns`) are covered by table-driven unit tests in
  `salvage_test.go`.
- `LookupCorpseSalvage` tests in `corpse_salvage_test.go` cover each
  table row, the no-match case, nil/empty input, and the
  first-entry-wins ordering guarantee (a mob with both `animal` and
  `humanoid` groups gets the `animal` row; a mob with both `rodent`
  and `animal` groups gets the `rodent` row).
- `integration_crafting_test.go` loads YAML from disk — requires
  the test binary to be run from the repo root or with the data path
  initialized by `test_main_test.go`.
- Adding a new `corpseSalvageTable` entry requires a matching test
  case in `corpse_salvage_test.go`.
- `enchant_salvage_map_test.go` covers all four band boundaries, roll
  hit vs miss for each probabilistic mat, the band-4 all-miss
  binding-paste floor, and `qtyBonus` stacking. Use
  `EnchantSalvageYieldWith` (inject a deterministic roll) for new
  tests; never call the live `EnchantSalvageYield` in unit tests
  (requires a loaded balance config).
