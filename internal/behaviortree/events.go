package behaviortree

// The pinned behavior-event vocabulary (5d). Events are matched by raw
// string equality at runtime with no boot validation — before this file, a
// typo'd `event:` was a silently dead node (the caravan wagon's on-death
// cargo drop authored `mob_death`, the QUEST engine's name; the btree engine
// fires `mob_die`, and the node never ran).
//
// events_test.go enforces BOTH directions against the Go dispatch sites:
// an event fired anywhere but missing here fails CI, and so does an entry
// here that nothing fires. The 5d editor refuses saves whose event isn't in
// this map.
