# DOGMud Spells System Context

## Overview

The DOGMud spells system provides a comprehensive magic framework with 45 spells across
multiple types and schools, a fold-based casting mechanic, use-based spell discovery, and
flexible targeting. Spells use Conviction (not mana) as their resource.

**DOGMud Differences from upstream GoMud:**
- Mana removed — spells use Conviction resource
- Optional Health costs for life-force magic (vital school spells may sacrifice health)
- Spell cost scaling via config multipliers (SpellConvictionCostMultiplier, SpellHealthCostMultiplier)
- Spellcasting skill (DOG) replaces legacy Cast skill for combat resolution
- Schools changed from single value to array (can have multiple schools)
- Four DOG schools: Elemental, Enhancement, Mental, Vital
- Use-based spell discovery (Phase 25) — no trainers, spells emerge through casting practice
- New effect types: dot, knockdown, purge (Phase 25)
- Starting spells reduced to 1 (Conviction Spike only)

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Spell Data Management:**
- Unique spell identification with string-based IDs
- YAML-based storage with automatic loading and validation
- Spell discovery by name or ID with fuzzy matching
- In-memory caching for fast spell lookups

**Spell Classification System:**
- Type-based targeting (single, multi, area, neutral)
- School-based categorization (elemental, enhancement, mental, vital)
- Harm/help classification for spell effects
- Difficulty scaling for success calculations

---

## SpellData Structure

```go
type SpellData struct {
    SpellId           string    // Unique spell identifier (also filename base)
    Name              string    // Display name
    Description       string    // Spell description
    Type              SpellType // Targeting and effect type
    Schools           []string  // Magic school classification (can have multiple)
    Cost              int       // Conviction cost
    HealthCost        int       // Optional Health cost for vital school
    WaitRounds        int       // Casting delay in rounds
    Difficulty        int       // Success modifier (0-100%)
    PrimaryStat       string    // REQUIRED (U9). Caster-side stat. See below.
    BaseFolds         int       // Number of folds required to cast
    TargetDefenseType string    // "physical", "mental", or "none"
    EffectType        string    // "damage", "heal", "shield", "dot", "knockdown", "purge", "none"
    EffectMagnitude   int       // Base power of the effect
    EffectDuration    int       // For DoT: number of tick cycles
}

func (s *SpellData) CasterStatValue(stats stats.Statistics) int
func (s *SpellData) Validate() error // calls the unexported validatePrimaryStat
```

**`PrimaryStat` is REQUIRED and validated at load (U9).** `Validate()` calls
the unexported `validatePrimaryStat`, which fails the boot if `primarystat:`
is empty or not one of the six stat names (`strength`, `dexterity`,
`perception`, `vitality`, `willpower`, `charisma`) -- a typo now fails at
startup instead of silently doing nothing, which is what the field used to
do (see the boot-test SOP in `CLAUDE.md`). `CasterStatValue(stats
stats.Statistics) int` reads the matching field off the caster's
`stats.Statistics` and is CASTER SIDE ONLY -- the defender's stat is owned
by the U6 defence set (`quell` stays on Willpower by design; routing it
through here would silently move quell off the stat U6 designed it around).

It drives:
- the caster's spell attack roll (`characters.CalcSpellAttack(spellData.CasterStatValue(...), skillLevel)`,
  `internal/hooks/spell_resolution.go`),
- spell duration and shield-bonus magnitude (`calcSpellDuration`, both via
  `spellData.CasterStatValue(...)`),
- and, in `internal/hooks/NewRound_DoCombat_helpers.go`, which stat the cast
  TRAINS: `OnSkillUseScaled` already rolls the casting skill's own default
  primary stat (spellcasting -> willpower, manifestation -> charisma), and an
  explicit `OnStatUse(spellData.PrimaryStat, userId)` fires ONLY when the
  spell's `primarystat` differs from that default -- so for every spell
  shipped at 2026-08-19 (which all declare willpower or charisma matching
  their school) this is a no-op in practice; it exists so a spell that
  declares something else actually trains it.

**It does NOT drive raw damage magnitude.** `calcSpellDamageForCharacter`
(`internal/hooks/combat_shared_helpers.go`) reads `caster.Stats.Willpower.ValueAdj`
directly through `combat.CalcRawDamage`, not `spellData.CasterStatValue(...)`.
A spell with a non-willpower `primarystat` still rolls its attack and trains
its progression off that stat, but its damage number is Willpower regardless.
This is not drift to "fix" without a design decision -- it is the current
shipped behaviour, and the Effect Types row below has been corrected to
match it rather than the aspiration.

### Spell Difficulty and Target Types

**Difficulty Field:** The `Difficulty` integer (range 0–75) affects skill
progression via difficulty-scaled bonus multiplier (applied in spell resolution).
Values: 0 (utility), 1–15 (weak combat), 15–30 (moderate), 30–50 (strong),
50–75 (apex combat spells).

**TargetTypeString:** `Neutral` spells now return "Self" instead of "Unknown"
for display purposes.

### Spell Types
```go
const (
    Neutral    SpellType = "neutral"    // No expected target
    HarmSingle SpellType = "harmsingle" // Single harmful target
    HarmMulti  SpellType = "harmmulti"  // Multiple harmful targets
    HelpSingle SpellType = "helpsingle" // Single beneficial target
    HelpMulti  SpellType = "helpmulti"  // Multiple beneficial targets
    HarmArea   SpellType = "harmarea"   // Area harmful effect
    HelpArea   SpellType = "helparea"   // Area beneficial effect
)
```

### Magic Schools
```go
const (
    SchoolElemental   = "elemental"   // Fire, ice, lightning, earth — offensive elemental magic
    SchoolEnhancement = "enhancement" // Buffs, shields, enchantments — augmentation magic
    SchoolMental      = "mental"      // Illusions, charms, telepathy — mind-affecting magic
    SchoolVital       = "vital"       // Healing, curing, life/death manipulation
)
```

## Effect Types (spell_resolution.go)

| EffectType | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `damage` | Direct HP damage to target(s). New pipeline (DamageMultiplier > 0) scales off Willpower always, NOT PrimaryStat -- see the PrimaryStat note above. Legacy path (DamageMultiplier == 0) scales off EffectMagnitude. |
| `heal` | Direct HP restoration to target(s) |
| `shield` | Applies ConditionShield with magnitude = damage absorbed |
| `dot` | Applies ConditionPoisoned; ticks for EffectDuration cycles (each cycle = 3 rounds in AutoHeal) |
| `knockdown` | Deals damage + knocks the target Supine (face-up "slams to the ground") via `Position.TransitionToSupine(MinRecoveryRounds: 1, TriggerKnockdownSpell)`. The legacy `CombatPosition = PositionProne` parallel-write is removed (T21 sunset). Future work may add a direction config to distinguish blast (Supine default) from shockwave (Prone). |
| `purge` | Removes poison buffs and ConditionPoisoned from target(s) |
| `none` | No automatic effect — spell behavior handled in Go hooks (used by buff spells, summons, utility) |

---

## Spell Discovery System (Phase 25)

Spells are learned through casting, not trainers. After each successful cast:

1. Base discovery chance: ~5% per cast
2. Scaled down by known spell count: `chance = baseChance / (1 + knownCount * 0.1)`
3. `GetEligibleSpells()` returns unlearned spells whose `BaseFolds` ≤ skill-gated threshold
4. Random selection from eligible pool
5. Player receives: "A new pattern crystallizes in your mind: <spell name>"

### Fold Threshold Table (MaxFoldsForSkill)
| Skill Level | Max Discoverable Folds |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 1–4 | ≤ 4 |
| 5–9 | ≤ 6 |
| 10–19 | ≤ 8 |
| 20–29 | ≤ 10 |
| 30–39 | ≤ 12 |
| 40–49 | ≤ 16 |
| 50–59 | ≤ 20 |
| 60–69 | ≤ 24 |
| 70–79 | ≤ 28 |
| 80+ | ≤ 32 |

### Starting Spells
New characters begin with only `mm` (Conviction Spike). All other spells are
discovered through casting practice.

## Buff Integration (Phase 25.3)

Several buff flags affect spell and combat systems:

| Flag | Effect | Applied In |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `damage-bonus` | +15% physical damage | NewRound_DoCombat.go |
| `haste` | Speed effects | Various |
| `slow` | Movement penalty | Various |
| `skill-progress` | 2x skill progression chance | progression.go |
| `mutation-rate` | 2x mutation progress gain | UserRoundTick.go |

## Summon Fields (U7b, 2026-08-15)

`SpellData` carries the summon contract in five fields:

```go
SummonMobId          int     `yaml:"summon_mob_id,omitempty"`
SummonPetMultiplier  float64 `yaml:"summon_pet_multiplier,omitempty"`
SummonComponentId    int     `yaml:"summon_component_id,omitempty"`
SummonRequiresCorpse bool    `yaml:"summon_requires_corpse,omitempty"`
SummonMinCorpsePool  int     `yaml:"summon_min_corpse_pool,omitempty"`
```

`SummonPetMultiplier` is the **single dial for a pet's tier**. It scales the
caster's own power into the companion's stat pool via
`characters.CalcCompanionPool`, and it scales `CompanionReserveDefault` into the
ongoing Conviction the companion reserves via
`characters.CompanionReserveBase`.

**Reservation is derived, never authored.** There is no per-spell reservation
field. `SummonConvictionReserve` used to be one and was deleted precisely
because a second authorable source of truth beside the multiplier drifts on the
first retune.

**Three fields were removed and must not be re-added casually.**
`SummonBasePool` and `SummonScalingDivisor` went with the old formula, in which
the pet's base pool multiplied the caster's power and the corpse was averaged in
afterwards, so the corpse's share grew until it swamped the pet choice.
`SummonConvictionReserve` went for the reason above. `Validate` now warns when
`SummonMobId > 0` and `SummonPetMultiplier <= 0`; it used to warn on a zero
`summon_base_pool`.

## Summon Spells (Phase 25.4)

Two permanent summon spells use components, resolved in Go hooks:
- `chrysalis-construct` (20 folds) — requires Chrysalis Core (item 40010), spawns mob 110
- `summon-hive-swarm` (24 folds) — requires Hive Fragment (item 40011), spawns mob 111

Summons persist until killed, one per type per caster. Go hooks in
`spell_resolution.go` handle component checking/consumption, mob spawning,
and permanent charm via `CharmSet(userId, 99999)`.

## Hook Integration Points

| Hook File | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `internal/hooks/spell_resolution.go` | Effect dispatch (damage, heal, shield, dot, knockdown, purge), HelpArea targeting. U9: the player- and mob-caster magical-crit branches build a `progression.Outcome{ToughenStat: characters.ToughenStatFor("magical"), Exceptional: progression.ExcAttackCrit}`, take `progression.BonusEvents`, and apply only the defender side via `target.Character.ApplyProgression(...)` -- see `internal/progression/context.md` and `internal/characters/context.md`'s "Contest Progression Seam" section. |
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_DoCombat_helpers.go` | Ordinary casting progression: `OnSkillUseScaled` on the casting skill (spellcasting or manifestation), then `OnStatUse(spellData.PrimaryStat, ...)` when it differs from that skill's default stat. |
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_DoCombat.go` | Spell discovery after cast, DamageBonus buff check |
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_AutoHeal.go` | Mob poison DoT ticking |
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_UserRoundTick.go` | MutationRate buff check |
| `internal/characters/progression.go` | SkillProgress buff check (2x casting skill gain) |
