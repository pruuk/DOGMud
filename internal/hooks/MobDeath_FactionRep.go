// MobDeathFactionRep records a murder crime + adjusts faction rep
// when a player kills a faction-member mob. Rewritten in chunk 1.3
// to be crime-aware:
//
//   - Each defined faction the dead mob belonged to gets a crime
//     row recorded.
//   - Witness check determines whether the perpetrator is identified
//     (player) or unknown (lone murder, no rep impact).
//   - When an unresolved assault crime exists for this player +
//     faction within the lookback window, that row is upgraded
//     in-place to murder; rep delta becomes the incremental
//     CrimeRepDeltaMurder - CrimeRepDeltaAssault. Otherwise a new
//     murder row is recorded with the full CrimeRepDeltaMurder.
//   - Party-room propagation from chunk 1.2 is preserved: any party
//     member of a damager who's in the same room at death-time also
//     takes the bump.
