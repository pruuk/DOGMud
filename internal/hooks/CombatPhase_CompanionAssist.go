// wireCompanionAssist registers an Attackers-change subscription on
// every character. When the inbound Attackers list grows, the handler
// checks whether the character is a charmed companion. If so, and if
// the owner (and sibling companions) are Idle, they are directed to
// attack the new threat.
//
// This replaces the polling-based CompanionAutoTarget scan that ran
// in NewRound_DoCombat once per round. The new path fires reactively
// the moment a new attacker is recorded on the companion's CombatPhase,
// rather than waiting until the next round tick.
//
// Behavioral parity with the old polling path:
//   - Same AutoAssist flag check (companion entry on owner's character)
//   - Same grace-period check (NoAggroTarget buff on owner)
//   - Owner's own "attack owner's current target" path preserved via
//     the existing NewRound_DoCombat_helpers.go#handleCompanionOwnerAssist
//     for MvP attacks (which fires before the round loop, not here)
//   - Sibling companions in the same room are also directed to assist
//
// CompanionAutoTarget in combat_retarget.go still runs as a polling
// fallback in NewRound_DoCombat. Both paths may fire: the reactive
// (this file) fires when the attacker is first recorded; the polling
// path fires the next round tick. Duplicate attack commands are
// benign — the second attempt hits an already-fighting companion or
// is vetoed.
