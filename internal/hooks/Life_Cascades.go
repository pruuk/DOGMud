// wireLifeCrossMachineCascades registers cascade handlers on

// state machines to terminal states and clear scattered state.
// On Dead→Respawning, reset resources + apply grace buff.
//
// Per-actor concrete effects (loot, teleport, decay, KD
// tracking) live in their own observer files
// (Death_*.go, Respawn_*.go) in chunk-2 Tasks 6-8.
//
// Chunks 3 and 4 will repoint the Activity and Position
// pre-wires (currently raw field manipulation) to proper
// machine queries once those machines land.

					Trigger: combatphase.TriggerForceIdle,
				})

				// 2. Awareness → Visible (via ForceVisible)
				c.Awareness.ForceVisible(state.TransitionReason{
					Trigger: awareness.TriggerDeath,
				})

				// 3. Activity → Free is now handled by Activity_Cascades.go
				//    (chunk 3). The legacy CastingState/CraftingState pointer
				//    nil-outs that lived here are gone — Activity.TransitionToFree
				//    (fired by the activity_life_dead AfterTransition observer)
				//    clears the per-state data slots inside the machine.
				//
				// Transition-window note: legacy CastingState/CraftingState
				// fields are still being written by skill.cast.go and craft.go
				// until Tasks 6-7 add parallel-writes to the Activity machine.
				// During that window, a player who dies mid-activity will have
				// stale legacy pointer state. Task 11 deletes the legacy fields
				// entirely; Tasks 6-7 keep them in sync via parallel-write.

				// 4. Position → Standing is now handled by the
				//    Position FSM cascade (Position_Cascades.go) which
				//    fires on Life Alive→Dead. The legacy pre-wire that
				//    lived here is removed in chunk-4b R4 now that all
				//    production readers go through the FSM predicates.

				// 5. Buffs (non-permanent) → cancel all.
				c.CancelBuffsWithFlag(buffs.All)

				// 5b. Toxicity → clear. THIS MUST STAY BESIDE THE BUFF STRIP
				// ABOVE, because that strip is what justifies it: toxicity is
				// the price of a potion's effect, and the line above has just
				// removed every effect the player paid for. Leaving toxicity
				// behind would charge them twice for a benefit they no longer
				// hold -- they have already lost the potions, the materials and
				// the brewing time. Separating these two lines is what
				// re-creates the bug, and it also reopens a death spiral:
				// toxicity above 90% deals acute HP damage and decays at half
				// speed, so a player could respawn at 5% health still critical
				// and die again with no way out.
