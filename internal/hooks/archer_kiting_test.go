// TestHandleMobAIDecision_NilAggro_NoPanic guards the nil-Aggro crash on the
// fall-through path: when a mob's behavior tree does NOT handle the combat round
// (returns false) and the mob's aggro has already been cleared (e.g. a kiting
// archer whose target left the room), the round loop calls handleMobAIDecision
// with a nil Aggro. It must return false rather than deref nil and panic the
// whole server. (The sibling end-to-end test only covers the happy path where
// the archer btree fires and short-circuits before handleMobAIDecision.)

// TestHandleMobCombat_ArcherKitesAndFiresAfterAggroLoss is the end-to-end
// regression guard for the kiting-AI defect: an archer that has retreated one
// exit (so the round driver's ValidateAggro already ENDED its aggro) must NOT
// be skipped on the following round — its behavior tree must still fire and
// land a directional `shoot` in the input queue.
//
// What this test actually drives: the REAL unexported handleMobCombat round
// loop (NOT arch.Evaluate directly). It constructs the faithful post-retreat
// state — the archer sitting in room B with NIL aggro and a FRESH CombatMemory
// pointing at the player who is still in the adjacent room A — then runs one
// round and asserts the shoot command was enqueued. This exercises every gate
// the production round loop applies (health/non-combatant/zone-active/aggro-nil
// branch + the new archerReengageable exemption + TryMobBehavior archetype
// dispatch). The two-round melee→retreat prelude is covered separately by the
// behaviortree keep_distance unit test (which asserts CombatMemory refresh).
