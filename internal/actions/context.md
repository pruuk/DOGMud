# actions — Package Documentation

## Overview

The `actions` package provides the core runtime implementations of in-game
actions — both simple queries (Consider) and complex multi-phase operations
(Combat, Skill, Craft, etc.). Each action is implemented as a public function
that accepts an `Actor` (player or mob abstraction) and target context, then
returns a `*Result` struct with outcome data.

**Structure:**
- Actions are called by user commands (`internal/usercommands/`), mob commands
  (`internal/mobcommands/`), and behavior tree primitives
  (`internal/behaviortree/`).
- Each action returns a structured result for programmatic consumption.
- Shared actions own mechanical outcomes. Player-command wrappers retain
  private player-only rendering decisions; in particular, shared cost admission
  returns `characters.CostCommitResult` and never emits a refusal line for an
  actor.
- Skill progression (`OnStatUse`, `OnSkillUse`) is triggered within actions,
  not by callers.

---

## Actor Abstraction

The `Actor` interface unifies player and mob behavior:

```go
type Actor interface {
	GetCharacter() *characters.Character
	GetRoom() *rooms.Room
	SendText(cat messaging.Category, msg string)
	SendRoomCommunication(msg string, excludeSelf bool)
	GetName() string
	IsPlayer() bool
	GetUserId() int                 // 0 for mobs
	GetMobInstanceId() int          // 0 for players
	AddBuff(buffId int, source string)
	OnStatUse(stat string) bool
	OnSkillUse(skill string) bool
	OnCriticalSuccess(skill string)
	OnCriticalFailure(skill string)
}
```

### Action-cost admission

`admitFullCost` is the internal voluntary-action seam. It creates a neutral
single-unit request, then delegates the full-or-refuse decision, pool update,
and fractional carry to `Character.QuoteActionCost` and `Character.CommitCost`.
It performs no direct `ApplyCost*` call and emits no private text. U8 shared
action results carry the returned `CostCommitResult`; user wrappers can
render a refused status through `CostRefusalText`, while equivalent mob wrappers
stay silent.

- **UserActor** (`actor_user.go`): wraps a `*users.UserRecord`, sends text via
  `user.SendText()`, skill progression goes through `user.Character.OnSkillUse()`.
- **MobActor** (`actor_mob.go`): wraps a `*mobs.Mob`; `SendText` is a no-op
  because a mob has no private player connection. `SendRoomCommunication` is
  the NPC room-broadcast path, routed through the room's visual messaging
  pipeline. Skill progression goes through `mob.Character.OnSkillUse()`.

---

## Combat Actions

### Every player attack path MUST seed aggression

`SeedAggression(user, mob, room, freshAggro)` in `aggression.go` is what makes
an attack visible to the revenge, opinion and justice systems. An attack path
that does not call it is invisible to all three: no assault crime, no faction
rep hit, no bounty check, no witness knowledge, no revenge-mob seeding.

That was not hypothetical. Until 2026-08-14 only `attack`, `shoot` and (half of)
`taunt` seeded anything, so the ten melee specials and `throw` let a player open
on a faction NPC for free. Killing it was still caught by the death hook's
murder record, but assaulting and walking away cost nothing.

**You almost certainly do not need to call it directly.** Admission-gated
physical specials call `StageMeleeTarget` and carry its returned `Actor` into
their shared `Execute*` function. The action resolves that staged target
read-only, admits cost, consumes cooldown, then commits aggro and calls
`SeedAggression`. Invalid, stale, cooldown-blocked, and cost-refused attempts
therefore cannot seed combat side effects. Taunt uses the same staged engagement
contract. `AcquireMeleeTarget` is **deleted**: it was the pre-U8 eager
gate-and-engage helper, it had no production callers left, and keeping it would
have kept an engage-before-paying path available to a future command. `throw`
seeds from its own `engageAfterThrow` because it is an AoE.

The two halves fire on **deliberately different** conditions, and getting this
backwards spams crimes and bounties off a single engagement:

| Signal | Fires when | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `PlayerAttackedMob` event | **every** commitment | Seeder rules 6 and 9 want repeated aggression, not just the opener |
| Opinion bump + assault crime | **fresh aggro only** | Otherwise every kick of a long fight re-logs a crime and re-bumps rep |

"Fresh" is the caller's judgement because it differs by shape. Single-target
moves compare the *attacker's* prior aggro against this mob. An AoE like `throw`
judges it *per mob*, from that mob's own prior aggro, because the attacker's
aggro can only point at one target and attacker-side gating would record the
first mob hit and silently miss the rest.

`RecordAssaultCrime` lives here rather than in `internal/usercommands` for this
reason: the specials engage through this package, and `usercommands` already
depends on it.

### Thrown weapons: `throw` is the grenade verb, aimed throws are ranged

Settled 2026-08-14, recorded here so it is not re-argued:

- **`throw`** (in `internal/usercommands`) is untargeted **by design**. It takes
  an item, never a target, and resolves as a room AoE rolled independently
  against every hostile present. Same shape as an AoE spell. Do not add a target
  argument to it.
- **Aimed thrown weapons** (darts, javelins, throwing knives) belong under
  `ranged-combat` and `ExecuteFire`, which already has single-target resolution,
  cross-room shots, Perception-based aiming, reload machinery, and correct crime
  and revenge seeding. Skullduggery suits an improvised explosive; it does not
  suit a javelin.

Not yet built. The one open problem is that a thrown weapon is its own
ammunition, while `ExecuteFire` requires a wielded ranged weapon via
`findRangedWeaponSlot`. Either such a weapon equips and consumes itself on use,
or a `thrown` weapon subtype gets taught to that resolver. A feature, not a
refactor.

### Basic Attack

**Function:** `combat.AttackPlayerVsMob(user, mob)`, `combat.AttackMobVsPlayer(mob, user)`, etc.

Handled by the combat system (`internal/combat/`), not the actions package.
See `internal/combat/context.md` for full details.

### Special-Move Actions & Anatomy Gating (Phase 2)

The shared special-move actions (`ExecuteGrapple`, `ExecuteBash`,
`ExecuteTrip`, `ExecuteKick`, `ExecuteHamstring`) each carry a
defense-in-depth anatomy guard mirroring the AI `CanUse*` gate in
`internal/combat/ai.go` and the parity check in `command_readiness.go`:
grapple/submit need `arms`, trip/kick need `legs`, bash needs
`(shield|NaturalBash) AND (arms|NaturalBash)`. These three sites form a
`// SYNC POINT` triad — change one, change all; `command_readiness_drift_test.go`
asserts the gate and `CommandIsReady` stay in agreement (the `*_no_arms`
/`*_no_legs` rows). The action-entry guard is unreachable for players
(always humanoid) and reuses the nearest existing failure flag
(`GrappleImmune`, `NoShield`, `NoTarget`) rather than minting a new one.

**Retired:** `ExecuteBite`/`BiteResult` were removed — biting is now the
Phase-1 basic attack for fanged species (species `NaturalAttack`).
`mobOnlyCommands` no longer lists `bite`. `toxic-bite` (mutation) stays.

### Beast Special Moves (Phase 3)

Six new `Execute*` actions gated by exported species-identity predicates
from `internal/combat` (`SpeciesIsFanged`, `SpeciesIsClawed`,
`SpeciesIsHorned`, `SpeciesHasLifeDrain`, `SpeciesIsQuadrupedPredator`).
Each action checks the predicate at entry as defense-in-depth and returns
a `Not<Identity>` result if the caller's species doesn't qualify. The
same predicate is checked in `ai.go` (`CanUse*`) and
`command_readiness.go`; drift rows in `command_readiness_drift_test.go`
keep all three sync points in agreement.

**Phase 4 — the `hands` gate.** Each of the six beast actions (incl.
`ExecuteHamstring`, which gained an explicit identity gate in Phase 4)
ALSO rejects an actor with a `hands` body part at the entry — beast
natural-weapon moves are for true beasts, not tool-using humanoids. The
`*_hashands` drift rows pin it. `ExecuteDrain` is EXEMPT (LifeDrain-flag
gated), so armed undead still drain.

| Action | Gate | Effects |
|--------|------|---------|
| `ExecuteRake` | clawed | Damage + short bleed |
| `ExecuteMaul` | fanged | Heavier damage + stronger bleed |
| `ExecutePounce` | quadruped predator, not grappling | Knockdown + damage (no bleed) |
| `ExecuteGore` | horned | Damage + knockback |
| `ExecuteDrain` | `LifeDrain` flag | Damage + heal attacker (`damage × DrainHealRatio`) via `Character.Heal` |
| `ExecuteThrottle` | fanged | Damage + bleed + Throttled buff #89 (stamina DoT) + cast interrupt via `InterruptTargetCast` |

**`InterruptTargetCast`** is a shared helper that reuses the engine's
existing `activity.TriggerCastCancel` cast-cancel path (conviction
refund included). No new silence flag is introduced. `ExecuteThrottle`
calls it with a `ThrottleInterruptChance` (0.75) probability gate.

---

## Skill Actions

### Consider

**Function:** `Consider(actor, target) ConsiderResult`

Computes a power-ratio assessment of `target` from `actor`'s perspective.
- Returns `ConsiderResult` with `Ratio` (self power / target power), both
  absolute power values, and target name/type.
- **Progression:** Triggers `actor.OnStatUse("perception")`.
- **Messaging:** Sends a colored difficulty string to the actor (e.g.,
  "an easy opponent"). Mobs receive no feedback (SendText is a no-op).

---

## Skullduggery Actions (chunk 2.7)

### Sneak

**Function:** `Sneak(actor) SneakResult`

Attempts to transition the actor from Visible through Concealing to Hidden
after an opposed roll against every eligible observer in the room. A player
actor excludes themself and party members; a mob excludes itself.

- **Readiness and admission:** Already-Hidden, combat, activity, awareness,
  and room checks are read-only and run before cost admission. A valid attempt
  commits `ActionSneak` against Stamina using `SneakBaseStaminaCost`,
  Skullduggery's inverse-skill multiplier, physical encumbrance, and
  full-or-refuse policy. Only a paid admission may call
  `TransitionToConcealing` or roll observers.
- **Structured result:** `SneakResult.Cost` is the
  `characters.CostCommitResult` from admission. `CostRefused` means no
  awareness, cooldown, round, contest, or progression mutation occurred.
  `AlreadyHidden` and `InCombat` are pre-admission outcomes and therefore have
  a zero-value cost result.
- **Roll:** The sneaker uses effective Dexterity plus the Skullduggery skill
  multiplier and stealth bonuses, modified by light conditions per observer.
  Each observer uses effective Perception plus the Search skill multiplier.
  Resolution flows through `combat.RunContest`.
- **Success/failure:** Success resolves Concealing to Hidden, queues the Hidden
  buff mirror, sets the `sneaking` misc key, and returns `Success`. The first
  observer who wins resolves the actor back to Visible and populates
  `SpottedByName`. `RollHappened` distinguishes a contested attempt from an
  empty-room success.
- **Player wrapper ownership:** The user command owns the skill gate, busy and
  prior-failure-cooldown messages, stamina-refusal text, and player-facing
  success/failure text. It checks the prior failure cooldown with read-only
  `CooldownReady`; only a spotted paid attempt may apply
  `SneakFailCooldown`, and an absent/zero value remains disabled. Player
  Skullduggery progression runs only when `RollHappened` is true and only after
  paid resolution.
- **Mob wrapper ownership:** The mob command renders no refusal text and has no
  player failure cooldown. It returns immediately on `CostRefused`; only a
  successful paid attempt calls `OnSkillUse("skullduggery", 0)`.

### Steal

**Function:** `Steal(actor, opts) StealResult`

Pickpockets a target mob or player, or robs an item from a room container.

**Three paths:**

1. **Mob pickpocket** (`opts.TargetMobId` set):
   - Rolls `actor Dexterity + Skullduggery` vs `mob Dexterity +
     Skullduggery`.
   - If win: picks a random item from mob inventory.
   - If succeed: returns `StealResult.Success = true` and item ID.
   - If fail: returns `Success = false`.
   - **Messaging:** Always silent on the thief side (no feedback).

2. **Player pickpocket** (`opts.TargetUserId` set):
   - Rolls `actor Dexterity + Skullduggery` vs `player Perception +
     Skullduggery` (note: Perception, not Dex).
   - If win: picks a random item from player inventory.
   - **Detection roll (extra):** If the steal succeeds, rolls `actor
     Dexterity + Skullduggery` vs `player Perception + Skullduggery` again
     to determine if the player **notices**. If player notices, they receive
     "You notice someone trying to pickpocket you!" message. Theft still
     succeeds either way.
   - **Messaging:** Actor always gets silent feedback. Player gets the
     detection message only if the second roll fails.

3. **Container rob** (`opts.RoomContainerId` set):
   - No opposed roll. Opens the container and removes an item.
   - Always succeeds if the container has items.
   - Returns item ID.

**Progression:** Triggers `actor.OnStatUse("dexterity")` and
`actor.OnSkillUse("skullduggery")`.

**Cooldown:** Shares the `skullduggery` cooldown key (10 rounds).

**Result struct:**
```go
type StealResult struct {
	Success    bool
	ItemId     int
	ItemName   string
	Message    string  // feedback message
}
```

### Plant

**Function:** `Plant(actor, opts) PlantResult`

Slips an item from the actor's backpack onto a target mob or into a room
container.

**Two paths:**

1. **Plant on mob** (`opts.TargetMobId` set):
   - Rolls `actor Dexterity + Skullduggery` vs `mob Dexterity +
     Skullduggery`.
   - If win: removes item from actor backpack, adds to mob inventory.
   - If fail: item stays with actor, plant fails.
   - **Messaging:** Actor gets success/failure feedback. Mob (if aware) may
     receive a discovery message on next interaction (not immediate).

2. **Plant in container** (`opts.RoomContainerId` set):
   - No opposed roll. Removes item from actor backpack, adds to container
     inventory.
   - Always succeeds if the container exists.

**Item lookup:** `opts.ItemTag` is a space-separated noun (e.g., "copper
coin"). The function searches actor backpack for a matching item by display
name / simple name.

**Progression:** Triggers `actor.OnStatUse("dexterity")` and
`actor.OnSkillUse("skullduggery")`.

**Cooldown:** Shares the `skullduggery` cooldown key (10 rounds).

**Result struct:**
```go
type PlantResult struct {
	Success bool
	ItemId  int
	Message string
}
```

### Defuse

**Function:** `Defuse(actor, opts) DefuseResult`

Disarms a trap on a room container or exit. Optionally consumes a disarm kit
from the actor's backpack if `opts.UseKit` is true.

**Two paths:**

1. **Container trap** (`opts.ContainerId` set):
   - Finds the container, rolls opposed check: `actor Dexterity +
     Skullduggery` vs `container.TrapDifficulty`.
   - If win: removes the trap (sets `TrapId = 0`). Container is now safe.
   - If fail: actor takes damage (trap detonates). `actor.ApplyHealthChange(-damage)`.

2. **Exit trap** (`opts.ExitName` and `opts.Direction` set):
   - Finds the exit, rolls opposed check: same formula as containers.
   - On success: trap removed.
   - On fail: actor takes damage.

**Disarm kit consumption:** If `opts.UseKit` is true, the function searches
the actor's backpack for an item tagged "disarm kit" and consumes it on
success only. If no kit found, the action proceeds without it.

**Progression:** Triggers `actor.OnStatUse("dexterity")` and
`actor.OnSkillUse("skullduggery")`.

**Cooldown:** No cooldown (can defuse multiple traps per turn).

**Result struct:**
```go
type DefuseResult struct {
	Success          bool
	Message          string
	TrapDetonated    bool  // true if failed and trap triggered
	DamageDealt      int
}
```

### Scan

**Function:** `Scan(actor, opts) ScanResult`

Sweeps adjacent rooms for visible entities (non-hidden mobs/players).

**Mechanics:**
- **Adjacent rooms:** Scans in all four cardinal directions; lists any
  non-hidden mobs and players in the returned room descriptions.
- **Visibility:** Does not bypass hidden state — only visible entities are
  reported. Mobs/players who are hidden (buff 9) are not seen.
- **UserActor behavior:** Renders a "You sense:" list of adjacent-room
  entities with flavor text.
- **MobActor behavior:** Silent (no feedback).
- **Hostile-only mode:** `opts.HostileOnly = true` filters results to only
  entities the actor hates.

**Messaging:** UserActor receives "You sense: [adjacent rooms with entities]."
MobActor silent.

**Progression:** No stat/skill use triggered.

**Cooldown:** No cooldown.

**Result struct:**
```go
type ScanResult struct {
	Success        bool
	SightingFound  bool  // true if at least one entity seen
	Message        string
}
```

### Search

**Function:** `Search(actor, opts) SearchResult`

Three-tier discovery system: exits, stashed/hidden objects, and nouns.

**Mechanics:**
- **Tier 1 (Exits):** Lists all room exits (always succeeds for UserActor).
- **Tier 2 (Stashed items):** Searches containers and ground for hidden items.
- **Tier 3 (Hidden entities):** Detects hidden mobs/players in the room.
  Promoted to `ctx.SoftTarget` if hostile.
- **Ignores non-hostile Tier-3 hits:** If a hidden entity is not hostile,
  it is not set as SoftTarget.
- **UserActor behavior:** Renders progressive search feedback (what tiers
  were discovered, what was found).
- **MobActor behavior:** Silent; just seeds SoftTarget if hostile found.

**Messaging:** UserActor receives discovery feedback per tier. MobActor silent.

**Progression:** No stat/skill use triggered.

**Cooldown:** Shares the `search` key (configurable duration, typically
  2 rounds).

**Result struct:**
```go
type SearchResult struct {
	Success         bool
	HiddenHostile   bool  // true if hidden entity promoted to SoftTarget
	Message         string
}
```

---

## Sleep Action (chunk 3.3)

### Sleep

**Function:** `Sleep(actor, opts) SleepResult`

Applies buff 15 (Sleeping) to the actor. Combat-gated: fails if the
actor is currently in combat (`Aggro != nil`). Idempotent: if the
actor already has the Sleeping buff, returns `SleepResult.AlreadyAsleep
= true` with no additional buff applied.

- **Success:** Actor receives buff 15; returns `SleepResult.Success = true`.
- **Failure (combat):** Returns `Success = false` with messaging.
- **Messaging:** UserActor receives a "You lie down and close your eyes."
  message; the room sees "<Actor> lies down to sleep." MobActor messaging
  goes to the room only.
- **Progression:** No stat/skill progression triggered.
- **Cooldown:** None.

Entry points that call `Sleep`:
- `usercommands/sleep.go` — player `sleep` command
- `mobcommands/sleep.go` — mob `sleep` command
- `hooks/NewRound_IdleMobs_schedule.go` — schedule executor for
  `activity: sleeping` segments

**Result struct:**
```go
type SleepResult struct {
    Success       bool
    AlreadyAsleep bool
    Message       string
}
```

---

## Foraging & Salvage Actions (chunk 2.9)

### Forage

**Function:** `Forage(actor, opts) ForageResult`

Single forage attempt in the current room's biome. Gated by biome availability
and shared cooldown.

**Mechanics:**
- **Biome check:** Actor must have forager profile data for the room's biome.
  Returns Failure if biome not found in profile (wrong terrain type).
- **Cooldown:** Shares the `forage` key (6 rounds, config:
  `ForageActionCooldown`).
- **Item discovery:** On success, generates item based on biome's forage table.
  Returns `ForageResult.ItemId` and `ItemName`. On miss (roll failure) or
  cooldown, returns Failure.
- **Progression:** Triggers `actor.OnSkillUse("foraging")`.

**Result struct:**
```go
type ForageResult struct {
	Success   bool
	ItemId    int
	ItemName  string
	Message   string
}
```

### Salvage

**Function:** `Salvage(actor, opts) SalvageResult`

Single-tick salvage attempt. Modes: default targets first eligible corpse
(mob death items in room), optional `ItemUuid` targets a specific item.

**Mechanics:**
- **Corpse mode** (`opts.ItemUuid` empty): Scans room for corpse items
  (items with `on_corpse: true`). Salvages the first match. Returns Failure
  if no corpse items found.
- **Item mode** (`opts.ItemUuid` set): Salvages the specified item UUID
  directly (player per-tick invocation path).
- **Multi-round activity:** Salvage takes 1-5 rounds depending on ingredient
  gold value. Each ingredient is rolled independently per the skill-based
  recovery table.
- **Progression:** Triggers `actor.OnStatUse("perception")` and
  `actor.OnSkillUse("salvage")`.
- **Result:** Returns `SalvageResult` with success flag and recovered
  materials list (empty if roll failures on all ingredients).

**Result struct:**
```go
type SalvageResult struct {
	Success     bool
	Message     string
	RecoveredCount int  // number of materials recovered
}
```

### Shadow

**Function:** `Shadow(actor, opts) ShadowResult`

Follow a target while hidden. The actor must already be hidden (carries buff
ID 9) for Shadow to succeed.

**Mechanics:**
- **Prerequisite:** `actor.HasBuff(9)` must be true. If not, returns
  `Success = false`.
- **Target resolution:** `opts.TargetUserId` or `opts.TargetMobId` sets the
  follow target.
- **Storage:** On success, stores the target ID in the actor's misc-data
  under key `"shadow-target-mob"` or `"shadow-target-user"` depending on
  target type. Also applies buff 87 (Shadow status buff).
- **Auto-follow:** When the target moves to a new room, the actor's
  auto-follow system (in `modules/follow/`) automatically moves the actor
  with them if the actor carries buff 87 (`HasBuff(87)` gating in
  `usercommands/go.go`), maintaining the hidden state.
- **Reveal on attack:** If the hidden actor attacks before Shadow completes,
  the Hidden buff is cancelled and Shadow ends.

**Messaging:** On success, actor receives "You begin stalking [target]." On
failure, "You are not hidden."

**Progression:** No stat/skill use triggered (Shadow is a passive follow
mechanic).

**Cooldown:** No cooldown.

**Result struct:**
```go
type ShadowResult struct {
	Success    bool
	TargetName string
	Message    string
}
```

### Track

**Function:** `Track(actor, opts) TrackResult`

Trail-read (passive sniffing) or active tracking on a resolved target.

**Mechanics:**
- **Trail-sniff (no-arg):** `opts.TargetNoun` empty; reads the room's trail
  data (bloodstain, scent, tracks left by previous passage). Returns success
  if a trail exists; failure if none.
- **Active track (target noun):** `opts.TargetNoun` or target from Event/Aggro;
  enters tracking mode on the target. On success (adjacent trail/recent
  sighting), applies buff 86 (Track status) and misc-data pair
  (`tracking-<userId>` or `tracking-<mobId>` with arrival timestamp).
  Seeds `ctx.SoftTarget` for downstream scout actions.
- **UserActor behavior:** Renders trail-sniff results or tracking status.
- **MobActor behavior:** Silent; just applies buff/misc-data and seeds
  SoftTarget.

**Messaging:** UserActor receives trail feedback or tracking status. MobActor
silent.

**Progression:** No stat/skill use triggered (scout actions planned as
  skill-less in Phase 1).

**Cooldown:** Shares the `search` key (typically 2 rounds).

**Result struct:**
```go
type TrackResult struct {
	Success        bool
	TrailFound     bool  // true if trail exists (sniff) or track active (active)
	TargetName     string
	Message        string
}
```

---

## Sell Action (chunk 5.4)

### Sell

**Function:** `Sell(seller Actor, opts SellOptions) SellResult`

Shared seller entry point for players and mobs. Resolves the first willing
merchant in the seller's room, then sells matching items.

**Two sell models — important distinction:**

1. **SALE (gold transfer) via `actions.Sell`**: The merchant evaluates the
   item via `EvaluateBuyRules` / `GetSellPrice`, returns an offer price, and
   the item transfers to the shop's stock. For **player** sellers the merchant's
   gold pool is drawn down by the sale price (`shopInv.Gold -= sellValue` or
   `mob.Character.Gold -= sellValue`), and a merchant-broke gate prevents
   sales the merchant can't afford. For **mob** sellers the seller is credited
   (`char.Gold += sellValue`) but **shop gold is not touched** — mob sales
   mint gold without bankrupting the shop (gated on `seller.IsPlayer()`).

2. **SUPPLY HANDOFF (free, no gold) via `forager.SellToVendor` and
   `forager.BackfillVendorFromChests`**: Forager delivery and chest backfill
   transfer items directly into vendor stock with no price computation and no
   gold movement. These are supply-side operations, not market transactions.

**SellAllSellable mode** (`opts.SellAllSellable = true`): Mob inventory-sweep.
Iterates every item in the seller's backpack that is not a quest token, not a
crafting material, and has `Value > 0`; calls `sellOneToMerchant` for each.
Used by the goal planner's wealth-gold sell step.

**Options struct:**
```go
type SellOptions struct {
    ItemName        string // ignored when SellAllSellable
    Quantity        int    // 1, N, or UnlimitedSell (math.MaxInt)
    SellAllSellable bool   // mob inventory-sweep mode
    MerchantName    string // optional target; "" = first willing merchant
}
```

**Result struct:**
```go
type SellResult struct {
    Sold         int
    TotalGold    int
    Reason       SellStopReason
    LastItemName string
}
```

`SellStopReason` values: `SellStopSoldAll` (normal), `SellStopNoItem`,
`SellStopNoMerchant`, `SellStopMerchantBroke` (player path only),
`SellStopRejected`.

**Messaging:** Player sellers receive "You don't have that item." and merchant
speech lines synchronously (not via the mob's async command queue — see
`merchantSay` in `sell.go`). Mob sellers receive no feedback text.

**Progression:** Triggers `seller.OnSkillUse("bartering")` and
`mob.Character.OnStatUse("charisma")` on each successful sale.

Entry points that call `Sell`:
- `usercommands/sell.go` — player `sell` command
- `mobcommands/sell.go` — mob `sell` command
- `internal/planners/` — goal planner's wealth-gold save-up sell step

**See also:** `internal/forager/vendor_sell.go` (`forager.SellToVendor`) and
`internal/forager/chest_backfill.go` (`forager.BackfillVendorFromChests`) for
the free supply-handoff paths — these are NOT routed through `actions.Sell`.

---

## Counter tier (U6b Task 10)

`combat_counter.go` wires the counter tier on this package's exits:

- `counterSkillMoveExit(actor, defender, move, channel, sameRoom)` fires
  `combat.ExecuteCounter` at every `ExecuteSkillMove` consumer's
  defensive-crit exit (bash/gore/hamstring/kick/maul/pounce/rake/throttle/
  trip/drain/drain-area, plus `ExecuteFire` with `sameRoom = !crossRoom` —
  the cross-room shot is the ONE uncounterable attack). It refuses results
  carrying `SkillMoveResult.IsCounter`, so a counter never earns a counter.
- `executeCounterTaunt(counterer, target)` is the defy carve-out: a defy CRIT
  counter-TAUNTS instead of counter-swinging, wired at `ExecuteTaunt`'s exit
  (`counterTauntExit`) because `internal/combat` cannot import this package.
  It bypasses the special-move cooldown, U8 admission cost, and all aggro
  mutation (owner decisions 2026-08-19), reuses only the contest + damage
  shape of taunt resolution, and never inspects its own contest's
  `DefensiveCrit`. `TauntResult.Counter` carries its outcome.

Counter-swings route through the seam, so the ORIGINAL attacker defends them
and is charged + progressed for it (the countered-party economy). Narration
is generic Task 10 text dispatched from these helpers; Task 11 ships
channel-correct counter triads.

## Available Actions Summary

| Action | Package | Actor→Target | Returns | Messaging | Cooldown |

## Options Structs

All chunk 2.7+ actions expose `<Verb>Options` structs for caller-side target
structuring:

```go
type DefuseOptions struct {
	ContainerId int    // container with trap
	Direction   string // cardinal (north/south/east/west)
	ExitName    string // friendly exit name
	UseKit      bool   // whether to consume disarm kit
	// ContainerId checked first; if 0, uses Direction+ExitName
}

type PlantOptions struct {
	ItemTag           string // noun phrase from command
	TargetMobId       int    // mob to plant on
	RoomContainerId   int    // container to plant in
	// Only one of the two should be set; TargetMobId checked first
}

type ScanOptions struct {
	HostileOnly bool // if true, only return entities actor hates
}

type SearchOptions struct {
	// No options — Search discovers all tiers in the room
}

type ShadowOptions struct {
	TargetUserId string // player to shadow
	TargetMobId  int    // mob to shadow
	// Only one should be set; TargetUserId checked first
}

// Sneak has NO options struct. Its entry point is Sneak(actor Actor)
// SneakResult: it targets self against every observer in the room, so there is
// nothing to configure.

type StealOptions struct {
	TargetMobId       int    // mob to pickpocket
	TargetUserId      string // player to pickpocket
	RoomContainerId   int    // container to rob
	// Only one of the three should be set; first non-zero wins
}

type TrackOptions struct {
	TargetNoun string // optional target noun for active track
	// Empty = trail-sniff; non-empty = active track on resolved target
}
```

## Caller Integration

**User commands** (`internal/usercommands/`): Parse CLI args into
`<Verb>Options`, call the action function, process the result struct.

**Mob commands** (`internal/mobcommands/`): Build options from command args
or script context, call the action function.

**Behavior trees** (`internal/behaviortree/`): BTree action primitives
(`try_sneak`, `try_steal`, etc.) populate options from `EvalContext.Event`
and `mob.Character.Aggro` context, call the action function, return
Success/Failure based on the result.

---

## Cooldown System

Skullduggery actions (Sneak, Steal, Plant) share a single cooldown key
(`"skullduggery"`). Config: `SkullduggeryActionCooldown` (default 10 rounds).

- Tracked in `Character.Cooldowns` map (string → int remaining rounds).
- Cooldowns decrement each round via combat hooks.
- Expired cooldowns are cleaned up lazily when checked.

---

## Dependencies

- `internal/characters` — Character stats, buffs, inventory, cooldowns
- `internal/combat`: power calculations (Consider), and contest resolution.
  The stealth, theft, trap and detection contests in `sneak.go`, `shadow.go`,
  `steal.go`, `plant.go` and `defuse.go` resolve through
  `combat.RunContest(attackScore, []contest.Entry{{Score: defenseScore}})`
  (U4 routed them to a wrapper, U6 collapsed every wrapper into this one entry
  point). Do not reach `internal/contest` directly; this package
  goes through `internal/combat`. The flat `dice.RollStat` threshold checks in
  `search.go` and `track.go` are NOT contests yet and are unassigned;
  `surprise_attack.go` has no hit resolution at all. All three are breadcrumbed
  in place.
- `internal/users` — Player character management
- `internal/mobs` — NPC management
- `internal/rooms` — Room context, containers, exits
- `internal/items` — Item specs, damage calculations
- `internal/buffs` — Buff system (Hidden buff for Sneak/Shadow)
- `internal/skills` — Skill progression and names
- `internal/modules/follow` — Auto-follow (used by Shadow)

## Files

The package is one file per action, plus a small shared core. Naming is the
map: `combat_*.go` is a combat special, `mutation_*.go` a mutation active, and
the rest are ordinary verbs.

| Group | Files |
|-------|-------|
| Actor abstraction | `actor.go`, `actor_user.go`, `actor_mob.go` |
| Readiness gates | `action_readiness.go`, `command_readiness.go` |
| Targeting | `target_resolution.go`, `target_helpers.go`, `melee_target.go`, `sleeping_target.go` |
| Shared helpers | `combat_helpers.go`, `skill_helpers.go`, `mutation_helpers.go`, `aggression.go` |
| Combat specials | `combat_attack.go`, `combat_bash.go`, `combat_counter.go`, `combat_drain.go`, `combat_fire.go`, `combat_gore.go`, `combat_grapple.go`, `combat_hamstring.go`, `combat_kick.go`, `combat_maul.go`, `combat_pounce.go`, `combat_rake.go`, `combat_rally.go`, `combat_reload.go`, `combat_taunt.go`, `combat_throttle.go`, `combat_trip.go`, `combat_warcry.go` |
| Casting | `cast.go`, `cast_interrupt.go` |
| Mutation actives | `mutation_cocoon.go`, `mutation_venom_coat.go` |
| Stealth / perception | `sneak.go`, `shadow.go`, `search.go`, `scan.go`, `track.go`, `surprise_attack.go`, `steal.go` |
| Items & economy | `get.go`, `drop.go`, `give.go`, `transfer.go`, `buy.go`, `sell.go`, `remove_equip.go` |
| Trades | `craft.go`, `salvage.go`, `forage.go`, `plant.go`, `defuse.go` |
| Movement & state | `go.go`, `sleep.go`, `consider.go` |
| Social | `say.go`, `emote.go`, `emote_aliases.go` |
| Divergences | `divergences.go` — deliberate departures from upstream behaviour |

**The actor seam is the point of this package.** `actions.Actor` lets one
implementation serve both players and mobs, which is what keeps user and mob
commands in parity instead of drifting apart.
