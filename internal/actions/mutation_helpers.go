//  0. Activity exclusivity — actor must not be Crafting/Salvaging/Casting
//  1. Mutation ownership  — actor must have mutationKey in Mutations map
//  2. Combat requirement  — if combatRequired, actor must be in combat
//  3. Cooldown            — the shared "special-move" cooldown must be free
//  4. Stamina cost        — actor must have at least staminaCost stamina
//
// On success, staminaCost is deducted from the actor's Stamina and OK=true
// is returned. Stamina is ONLY deducted on full success, never on an
// intermediate block.
//

// for no other reason (matches the pattern used in forage.go, salvage.go,
// cast.go). Mob actors are silently gated (MobActor.SendText is a no-op).

// comment used to name — blinding-flash, blinding-spit, healing-gel,
// pacifism-aura, sonic-shout, toxic-bite — were RETIRED in the 0.14.0
// Chrysalis migration and have no Trigger functions anymore.)
