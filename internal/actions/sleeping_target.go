// TargetAsleep reports whether a character is asleep for the purposes of
// player-initiated social and trade interaction.
//
// Sleep is a real state with real consequences — sleepers take an auto-critting
// first round and 5x regen — but until 2026-07-30 only `steal` respected it.
// `ask`, `give`, `buy`, `sell` and `list` all ignored it, so a player could hold
// a full conversation with a sleeping tavern keeper, be granted a quest by him,
// and hand a quest item to a sleeping guard captain. That is not a corner case:
// 113 of 132 authored schedules put the NPC to sleep IN their own workplace, so
// most shopkeepers in the world are asleep on the spot at night.

// RefuseIfAsleep is the single gate every player-initiated interaction with an

//
// Deliberately a refusal rather than a wake-up: sleeping is meant to mean
// something, and a shop that trades at 3am with its keeper snoring in the
// corner makes the schedule system decorative. The player is not dead-ended,
// though — `shout` already wakes every sleeper in the room (see
// usercommands/shout.go), so the message points at that. Damage, a failed
// steal, a light source entering, and the end of the sleep schedule segment
// also wake them.
//
// IMPORTANT for `give`: give.go transfers the item to the mob BEFORE any
// handler fires and cannot undo it, so this MUST be called before the transfer,
// not from a handler.
