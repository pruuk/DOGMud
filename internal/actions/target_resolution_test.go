//     placed in room 1; second instance 101 (name "Wraith") also in room 1
//     for tests that need multiple mobs.

// TestResolveTargetActor_StaleMobId: the instance is destroyed but its id is

//
// BEHAVIOUR CHANGED 2026-08-08. This test used to assert ErrTargetVanished,
// and its comment noted that the name-based path "dereferences the mob record
// without nil-checking inside findMobByName itself (mob.Character.IsCharmed()),
// which would crash before reaching the helper". That crash was a real bug,
// found in a user playtest as phantom "Sala the Mender #1 / #2" NPCs that
// could not be looked at and that broke targeting for every other mob in the
// room. It is now fixed two ways:
//
//   - Room.GetMobs no longer surfaces ids whose instance is gone, so a stale
//     id is not offered to any caller.
//   - findMobByName nil-checks before the deref.
//
// Because GetMobs filters first, a destroyed instance is no longer part of the
// room at all, so "not found" is the accurate answer rather than "vanished".
// The assertion was updated to match the fix, not the fix bent to match the
// assertion.
//
// The helper's ErrTargetVanished guard is still load-bearing: it covers the
// genuine race where the registry is mutated BETWEEN FindByName and the
// helper's own GetInstance call. That window cannot be simulated
// deterministically here, which is why this test now pins the pre-destroyed
// case instead.
