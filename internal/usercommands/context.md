# User Commands Package Context

## Overview
The `internal/usercommands` package implements the complete command system for player interactions in GoMud. It defines all player-executable commands, from basic movement and communication to complex skills, combat actions, and administrative functions.

## Key Components

### Command Architecture (`usercommands.go`)
- **UserCommand function signature**: Standardized interface for all commands
  ```go
  type UserCommand func(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error)
  ```
- **CommandAccess structure**: Defines command permissions and restrictions
- **Command registry**: Central mapping of command names to implementations
- **Permission system**: Admin-only commands and downed-state restrictions

### Command Categories

#### **Basic Interaction Commands**
- **Movement**: `go`, `flee` - Navigation and escape mechanics
- **Communication**: `say`, `shout`, `whisper`, `emote`, `broadcast` - Player communication
- **Observation**: `look`, `inspect`, `consider`, `who`, `online` - Information gathering
- **Inventory**: `inventory`, `get`, `drop`, `give`, `put` - Item management

#### **Combat Commands**
- **Direct combat**: `attack`, `shoot`, `reload`, `throw` - Offensive actions
  (`shoot` fires a loaded ranged weapon; `reload` chambers the next round,
  consuming one ammo bundle from the pack)
- **Combat skills**: `disarm`, `tackle`, `backstab`, `recover` - Specialized combat techniques
- **Defensive**: `flee`, `aid` - Escape and assistance mechanics
- **Beast special moves (Phase 3)**: `rake`, `maul`, `pounce`, `gore`,
  `drain`, `throttle` — registered as player commands for full
  player↔mob parity, but gated at the action entry by species-identity
  predicates (`combat.SpeciesIsFanged`, `SpeciesIsClawed`,
  `SpeciesIsHorned`, `SpeciesHasLifeDrain`, `SpeciesIsQuadrupedPredator`).
  Baseline humanoid players cannot use them; they are intended for beast
  mobs and future beast-mutated players. The action returns a
  `Not<Identity>` result for ineligible callers. See
  `internal/combat/context.md` "Beast Moveset (Phase 3)" for full
  gate and mechanic details.

#### **Skill-Based Commands**
- **Magic system**: `cast`, `enchant`, `unenchant`, `prepare` - Spellcasting mechanics
- **Stealth**: `sneak`, `picklock`, `pickpocket`, `peep` - Stealth and thievery
- **Utility skills**: `map`, `track`, `search`, `portal` - Exploration and navigation
- **Crafting**: Various skill-based creation and modification commands

#### **Economic Commands**
- **Trading**: `buy`, `sell`, `list`, `offer`, `appraise` - Commerce mechanics
- **Banking**: `bank` - Financial management
- **Services**: `train` - Character development

#### **Town Justice Commands** (5.1c)
- **`fine`** (`jail.go`): Shows a jailed player their current decaying fine
  and how to pay it. Uses `justice.JailInfo` + round math to compute the
  remaining gold owed.
- **`payfine`** (`jail.go`): Deducts the current fine from the player's
  on-person gold (bank as fallback) and calls `justice.ResolveDetention`
  to immediately release them. Blocks if the player cannot cover the fine.

#### **Social and Party Commands**
- **Party system**: `party` - Group management and coordination
- **Pets**: `pet`, `tame` - Animal companion system
- **Character management**: `character`, `set`, `alias` - Character customization.
  The `set` command supports a `set arrest <surrender|resist>` subcommand
  (`cmdSetArrest` in `set.go`) that stores `characters.ArrestPolicy` on the
  character. Default is `surrender`. The `resist` policy causes guards to
  attack immediately rather than wait through the arrest grace window.
  The `set combatverbosity <full|medium|light>` subcommand sets
  `UserRecord.CombatVerbosity` (persisted in the user YAML). `full` is
  the historical default; `medium` shows landed hits only (dodge/parry/block
  lines suppressed); `light` replaces per-swing lines with one compact
  summary per round. The viewer's floor rules (deaths, position-changing
  moves, and blows directed at the viewer) always pass regardless of
  setting; spectated fights render one step quieter than the viewer's own
  setting.

#### **Administrative Commands** (Admin-only)
- **World building**: `room`, `build`, `zone` - Environment creation and modification
- **Entity management**: `mob`, `item`, `spawn` - Game object manipulation
- **Server management**: `server`, `reload`, `teleport` - System administration
- **Player management**: `grant`, `modify`, `mute`, `deafen` - Player administration
- **Combat analytics**: `combatstats` - Combat analytics dashboard — view, filter, reset, export combat event data

### Command Processing Features

#### **Input Parsing and Validation**
- **Argument parsing**: Sophisticated parsing with quote respect for complex arguments
- **Target resolution**: Finding players, mobs, and objects by name or partial match
- **State validation**: Checking combat status, buffs, and other restrictions

#### **Permission and Security**
- **Role-based access**: Admin commands restricted by user permissions
- **State restrictions**: Commands blocked when downed, in combat, or affected by buffs
- **Cooldown management**: Time-based restrictions on command usage

#### **Event Integration**
- **Event flags**: Commands can be executed secretly or with special modifiers
- **Event emission**: Commands trigger events for logging and system integration
- **Combat integration**: Commands interact with combat state and aggro systems

### Skill Integration

#### **Skill-Based Commands** (`skill.*.go` files)
- **Cast system**: Magic spell casting with proficiency scaling
- **Brawling skills**: Physical combat techniques (disarm, tackle, throw)
- **Utility skills**: Map creation, portal magic, inspection abilities
- **Protection skills**: Aid and defensive capabilities
- **Search skill**: Discovery of hidden objects, containers, exits, and creatures

#### **Skill Validation**
- **Level requirements**: Commands check character skill levels
- **Proficiency effects**: Higher skill levels improve command effectiveness
- **Training integration**: Skills can be improved through use and training

### Administrative System

#### **World Management**
- **Room editing**: Comprehensive room modification capabilities
- **Zone management**: Creating and managing game world zones (note: `zone set autoscale` was removed in Phase 21; mob difficulty is now per-mob via `statpool`)
- **Spawn control**: Managing mob and item spawning

#### **Player Administration**
- **Character modification**: Changing player stats, levels, and properties
- **Punishment system**: Muting, deafening, and other disciplinary actions
- **Server monitoring**: System status and performance monitoring

### Special Features

#### **Command Suggestions**
- **Fuzzy matching**: Suggesting similar commands for typos
- **Context-aware help**: Relevant command suggestions based on situation
- **Admin filtering**: Different suggestions for admin vs regular users

#### **Dialogue–Quest Integration** (`talk.go`, `ask.go`)
- **PlayerState construction**: `buildPlayerState(user)` creates a
  `dialogue.PlayerState` with callbacks for `HasQuest`, `HasItem`,
  `RemoveItem`, `GiveQuest`, `GiveItem`, etc. — passed to all dialogue
  engine calls so NPC dialogue can be gated on quest progress and
  inventory. `GiveItem` returns whether the item actually reached the
  player (false when `StoreItem` refuses over carry capacity, or on an
  invalid item id) — the dialogue engine then withholds the node's
  other effects, including `grantsQuest` (2026-08-03 soft-lock fix)
- **Quest context for LLM**: `buildQuestContext(user, mobId)` returns
  human-readable quest summaries injected into the LLM system prompt
  via `llm.ConversationContext.QuestContext`
- **Item consumption**: `requiresItem` on dialogue nodes removes the
  item from the player's backpack on activation (via `RemoveItem`)
- **Quest advancement**: `grantsQuest` fires `events.Quest` to
  advance quest state; the quest event handler processes rewards

#### **Scripting Integration**
- **JavaScript exposure**: Commands can be called from game scripts
- **Function export**: Command functions available to scripting system
- **Event-driven execution**: Commands can be triggered by game events

#### **Alias System**
- **Custom shortcuts**: Players can create command aliases
- **Macro support**: Complex command sequences through aliases
- **Personal customization**: Per-character alias storage
- **Web panel sync**: `cmdSetMacro` (`set.go`) and `Alias` (`alias.go`)
  emit `events.AutomationChanged{UserId}` after every macro or alias
  change so the `gmcp.Automation` module immediately re-pushes
  `Char.Automation` and the web automation panel stays in sync.

## Dependencies
- `internal/users`: User management and character data
- `internal/rooms`: Room system for location-based commands
- `internal/events`: Event system for command effects and logging
- `internal/mobs`: NPC interaction and combat
- `internal/items`: Item manipulation and inventory management
- `internal/skills`: Skill system integration
- `internal/spells`: Magic system integration
- `internal/buffs`: Status effect checking and application
- `internal/scripting`: JavaScript runtime integration
- `internal/combat`: contest resolution. The four movement contests in `go.go`
  (a sneaking mover against each occupant, and the mover spotting hidden
  players and mobs on arrival), the one in `skill.skullduggery.shadow.go` and
  the one in `throw.go` all resolve through
  `combat.RunContest(attackScore, []contest.Entry{{Score: defenseScore}})`.
  U4 routed them to per-channel wrappers; U6 collapsed those into this single
  entry point. This package imports `internal/contest` for the `Entry` type
  only and must not call that package's roll functions directly.

## Usage Patterns
- Commands follow consistent signature and return conventions
- State validation occurs before command execution
- Events are emitted for logging and system integration
- Permission checks prevent unauthorized access
- Error handling provides user feedback and system logging

## Testing
The package includes comprehensive testing for:
- Command parsing and argument handling
- Permission and access control
- State validation and restrictions
- Integration with other game systems
- Administrative functionality

## Architecture Benefits
- **Modular design**: Each command is self-contained and focused
- **Consistent interface**: All commands follow the same signature pattern
- **Extensible system**: New commands can be easily added to the registry
- **Permission control**: Granular access control for different user types
- **Event integration**: Commands seamlessly integrate with the game's event system

## Search Skill System

### Overview
The `search` command discovers hidden objects in rooms, including hidden containers, hidden nouns, secret exits, and hidden mobs. Uses Perception-based rolls with per-discovery granularity.

### Search Roll Formula
```
searchScore = dice.RollStat(Perception + SkillMultiplier(searchRank) * 25.0)
```

- **Perception**: Character's current Perception stat (~100 baseline)
- **SkillMultiplier**: Sqrt curve from current search rank to soft cap (rank 50)
- **dice.RollStat**: Applies global `RollSpread` factor for variance
- **searchScore**: Single roll covers all discoveries in one `search` command

### Tier Difficulty Targets
| Target | Hidden Type | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 125 | Secret exits, hidden containers | Doors behind tapestries, false walls |
| 135 | Stashed items, hidden creatures | Boxes under beds, camouflaged mobs |
| 175 | Hidden nouns | Faint carvings, ancient runes |

### Per-Discovery Rolls
- Each hidden object in the room gets compared against `searchScore` individually
- Players with `searchScore ≥ target` discover that specific object
- Multiple discoveries possible in one `search` if roll is high enough
- Each discovery shows unique flavor text and adds to discovery tracking

### Anti-Botting Protection
- **Progression guard**: Search skill only gains progression if at least one undiscovered object was rolled against
- If all objects in the room are already discovered, skill use doesn't trigger progression
- Prevents skill grinding on discovered-only rooms

### Related Commands
- **`track`**: Uses search skill formula to find hidden tracks
- **`forage`**: Uses search skill formula to gather hidden resources
- All three commands use the same unified search score calculation

This package serves as the primary interface between players and the game world, providing a rich and comprehensive command system that supports all aspects of gameplay from basic interaction to advanced administrative functions.
## Files: one command per file

182 non-test files, and enumerating them would be noise — the filename **is**
the index. `command.go` implements `command`; `admin.<name>.go` is an admin
command; `skill.<name>.go` is a skill-gated one.

What matters is the shape, not the list:

- **Registration** is centralised. A command is not discovered from its
  filename; it is registered with its handler, its downed-allowed flag, and its
  admin-only flag. Modules register their own through
  `plugins.AddUserCommand` instead.
- **Handler signature:**
  ```go
  func Foo(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error)
  ```
  `rest` is everything after the verb — parse it, do not re-split the whole
  line.
- **User/mob parity.** Most commands have a `internal/mobcommands` twin. The
  boot-time `CommandParity` check warns when a user command has no mob
  equivalent and is not on the user-only allowlist. Adding one usually means
  adding both, or explicitly allowlisting.
- **Shared logic belongs in `internal/actions`**, behind `actions.Actor`, so
  the user and mob paths cannot drift. A command file should be argument
  parsing plus a call into `actions`.
- **Voluntary-action admission** is mechanical shared-action work. A user
  wrapper will render a private, pool-aware refusal only when its returned
  `CostCommitResult` has `Status == characters.CostRefused`; it must not
  re-quote, re-commit, or charge a pool directly.
- **Flee is the life-preserving partial-pay exception.** `Flee` first publishes
  a pending `fleeAdmission`, transitions to Disengaging, then commits cost and
  marks the admission ready. `TakeFleeAdmission(user) (includeSkill, ok)`
  atomically consumes only a ready admission in the asynchronous round hook;
  `CancelFleeAdmission` retracts pending or ready state when combat terminates.
  A rejected transition or an out-of-combat queued command spends nothing and
  publishes no attempt. `ok == false` is not reusable state: on a phase flee it
  means the command is still publishing or a resolver/cancellation already
  owns the attempt, while a true legacy `Aggro{Type:Flee}` path defaults to the
  historical full-skill behavior.
- **Casting interception preserves terminal semantics.** `flee` cancels a
  pending fold-cast only when the character is actually in combat; an
  out-of-combat rejection leaves the cast intact. The cancellation line never
  exposes the raw conviction already invested in the cast.
- **Player shortage lines are private and singular.** Autoattack, winning
  defence, flee, and grapple maintenance explain the skill-less resolution once
  at their owning round/action boundary. Losing defence candidates never emit a
  line. NPC wrappers use the same mechanics without private output.
- **Target resolution** uses the existing fuzzy matchers, which already handle
  multi-word input. Reach for `internal/parser` only when a command must
  *split* input into multiple slots (item vs. container, mob vs. player).

## Adding a command — the wiring checklist

Enumerate every step; a partially-wired admin command is the classic failure:
handler file, registration entry, help file, mob twin (or allowlist entry),
and — if it is player-facing — an entry in the relevant help category.

**If the command attacks a mob, it must seed aggression.** Admission-gated
melee specials and taunt route through `actions.StageMeleeTarget`; their shared
`Execute*` action commits engagement only after payment and cooldown. Anything
with its own targeting — `attack`,
`shoot`, `throw` — calls `actions.SeedAggression` itself. Skip it and the
attack is invisible to the revenge, opinion and justice systems: no assault
crime, no rep hit, no bounty, no witness memory. That was the real state of all
twelve special-move paths until 2026-08-14. See `internal/actions/context.md`
for the fresh-aggro contract, which is easy to get backwards.

When a taunt is defended, the coordinated Defy message is the complete result
for each audience. Do not also emit the ordinary taunt-hit narration; that
would describe the same resolution twice and can contradict the defence.

**`shoot` narrates three U10d flags, and one of them is an ordering trap.**
`FireResult.Revealed`, `SurpriseOnCooldown` and `AimedWhileEngaged` are set by
`actions.ExecuteFire`; `sendShootMessages` is the only thing that speaks them.

- `surpriseShotShooterLine(hit, triad, targetColored, tier, dealtDamage)` picks
  the shot-from-cover line. **The triad arm must stay ABOVE any damage-carrying
  arm.** `combat.SkillMoveResult.Hit` is `!Defended`, so a defended shot that
  still drew blood is `!hit && dealtDamage` — and the ORDINARY shot arms test
  that combination first, deliberately, to keep their damage-carrying line.
  Copying that order onto the ambush path shadowed the defence triad on every
  defended-partial ambush, so the shooter was never told what stopped it.
- The engaged-aim cue is latched once per engagement on
  `Character.RangedEngagedCueSpoken`. `shouldSpeakEngagedCue` returns both the
  speak decision and the value to store; storing `AimedWhileEngaged` verbatim is
  what re-arms the cue when the shooter gets clear, and it is also what heals
  the one case `EndAggro` cannot reach (a cross-room shooter who never held
  `Aggro` of their own).
- The ambush lines route through `messaging.CategorySurpriseAttack`, which no
  verbosity level suppresses. The engaged-aim cue does NOT: it fires on ordinary
  shots and is a mechanical explanation, so it uses `CategorySystem` like the
  cost refusal and defence shortage lines beside it.

None of these lines carries the melee `*[SURPRISE ATTACK]*` banner. A
20-column marker plus a target name plus a damage band does not fit in 80
columns, and these lines name the shot from cover in prose instead.
`shoot_narration_test.go` measures every composition at the p90 authored
mob-name length with the widest damage band.

**`attack` speaks the melee half of the same refusal, and the call ordering is
load-bearing.** `actions.EngageAggroType` returns `(aggroType,
surpriseOnCooldown)`; the second value is the melee twin of
`FireResult.SurpriseOnCooldown` and exists because `DefaultAttack` comes back
for two different reasons ("never hidden" and "hidden, but the shared
special-move timer refused the opener") and only the second may be spoken.
`sendMeleeAmbushDenial` is the only thing that speaks it, from both engagement
sites (player to mob, player to player), on `CategorySurpriseAttack` like the
ranged refusal.

- **Call it AFTER `SetAggro`.** The refusal is followed by a second line saying
  the attacker's cover is gone, and that line is gated on
  `Character.IsHidden()` read *after* the fact — the cascade that spends the
  cover (`internal/hooks/Awareness_Cascades.go`, on Idle to Engaging) runs
  inside `SetAggro`. Checking before it, or assuming the reveal happened, would
  lie on the `SetAggro` paths that return before the Combat Phase transition
  (the grace-period and taunt-hold guards) or have it vetoed.
- Losing cover for nothing is the real cost of a refused ambush, which is why
  there are two lines rather than one. Before this, the melee ambusher lost
  their cover, got an ordinary swing, and was told neither thing.
- The mob and behaviour-tree engagement paths discard the signal deliberately:
  it is feedback for the attacker, and their attacker is not a player.

**`throw` is the grenade verb and is untargeted by design** — it takes an item,
never a target, and resolves as a room AoE. Aimed thrown weapons (darts,
javelins) belong under `ranged-combat` and `ExecuteFire` instead. Settled
2026-08-14; the reasoning is in `internal/actions/context.md`.
