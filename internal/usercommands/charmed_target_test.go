// TestRegression_MeleeSpecialsRefuseCharmedTargets locks the fix for an
// inconsistency surfaced while extracting actions.AcquireMeleeTarget.
//
// `attack` has always refused charmed mobs ("%s is someone's companion!") and
// `taunt` refused them too, but bash, drain, gore, grapple, kick, maul, pounce,
// rake, throttle and trip did not. A player could therefore not attack another
// player's companion, but could freely bash, kick, grapple or trip it — the
// companion protection was bypassable by using any special move instead of the
// plain attack verb.
//
// The gate now lives in the shared preamble, so every melee special enforces it.
// The check is deliberately player-side only: mobs SHOULD be able to attack
// player companions, and mobcommands does not route through this helper.
