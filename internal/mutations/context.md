# internal/mutations — Package Context

## Purpose

Implements the Chrysalis mutation system introduced in **Stage 12.1** and
expanded in **Phase 24** with multi-effect mutations, conflicts, load-based
acquisition, active abilities, and quad-wielding support.

Mutations are the primary character-differentiation mechanic in DOGMud.
The Chrysalis (a world-spanning plague) reshapes characters who survive sustained
combat, granting both benefits and drawbacks each time it acts.

Adding a new mutation requires **only a YAML file** in
`_datafiles/world/dogmud/mutations/` — no Go code changes needed for existing
effect types.

## Key Concepts

### MutationSpec (mutations.go)
Each mutation is a `MutationSpec` loaded from a YAML file.  Fields:
- `mutationid` — filesystem key and registry key (`"tough-skin"`)
- `name` — display name (`"Tough Skin"`)
- `description` — player-facing flavor text
- `rarity` — 1 (common) … 10 (very rare); drives weighted acquisition pool AND load cost
- `visual` — appended to character look description
- `pro` / `con` — legacy single `MutationEffect{Type, Target, Value}` (migrated into lists)
- `pros` / `cons` — lists of `MutationEffect` (Phase 24+, supports multiple effects)
- `conflicts` — list of mutation IDs that cannot coexist with this mutation
- `active_ability` — optional active combat ability (Phase 24.5, see below)

### Backward Compatibility
Legacy `pro`/`con` single-effect fields are automatically migrated into the
`pros`/`cons` slices during `Validate()`. Existing YAML files work without changes.

### MutationEffect Types

| Type | Applied In | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `stat_multiplier` | `character.RecalculateStats()` | Multiplies `ValueAdj` after `Recalculate()`; Target = stat name |
| `stat_flat` | `character.RecalculateStats()` | Added to `Mods` before `Recalculate()`; Target = stat name |
| `natural_armor` | `character.GetPhysicalMitigation()` | Flat addition to physical mitigation % (also scored in `combat.PowerScore`) |
| `health_multiplier` | `character.RecalculateStats()` | Multiplies `HealthMax.Value` post-Recalculate; positive = more HP |
| `stamina_regen_multiplier` | `character.StaminaPerRound()` | Multiplies regen; negative = slower recovery |
| `natural_weapon` | `character.CalculateUnarmedDamage()` | Flat bonus to baseDamage |
| `magical_damage_reduction` | `hooks/spell_resolution.go` | Reduces incoming mob spell damage (0.0–1.0 fraction) |
| `conviction_cost_multiplier` | `usercommands/skill.cast.go` | Multiplies total conviction cost at cast initiation |
| `conditional_damage_low_hp` | `hooks/NewRound_DoCombat.go` | +20% physical damage when HP < 25% (Adrenaline Surge) |
| `aggro_magnet` | `mobcommands/lookfortrouble.go` | Multiplies target-selection weight for predatory mobs |
| `dodge_modifier` | `combat.calculateCombat()` | Flat dodge score bonus/penalty |
| `damage_multiplier` | `combat.calculateCombat()` | Multiply all outgoing physical damage |
| `movement_speed` | `character.GetMovementStaminaCost()` | Modify movement stamina cost (negative = faster) |
| `health_regen` | `hooks/UserRoundTick` | Passive HP regen per tick |
| `skill_progression_multiplier` | `character.CheckSkillProgression()` | Scale skill gain chance |
| `stat_progression_multiplier` | `character.CheckStatProgression()` | Scale stat gain chance |
| `flag` | various | Grant a permanent flag (nightvision, hidden, see-hidden). Not light: since lighting plan 5a a light is a condition declaring `light_strength`, not a flag, and `describe.go` no longer phrases a `lightsource` grant. `Target` names the flag; `Value` is read by `FlagValue` (below) for flags that carry a magnitude, such as the vision window's strength/reach numbers. Presence (`GetMutationFlags`, `HasMutationFlag`) never scaled with rank, but `Value` had been silently discarded until graded lighting plan 2 gave it a reader. |
| `health_regen_if_lit` | `hooks/UserRoundTick` | HP regen only in lit rooms |
| `gear_effectiveness_loss` | `character.StatMod()`, `itemvalue.ItemValueDelta()` | Percentage loss (0–1.0) applied to all gear-derived values; summed across owned mutations. **Special carve-out: uses raw level multiplication (ranks 1–4 = 0.25/0.50/0.75/1.00), NOT `LevelMultiplier`**. Reason: percentage-loss effects need linear scaling so rank 4 = exactly 100% loss. Consumers apply `(1.0 - loss)` multiplier. Clamped to [0.0, 1.0]. |
| `physical_defense_bonus` | `combat.calculateCombat()` | Flat additive bonus to defender's roll margin for physical-channel attacks; summed across mutations. Uses standard `LevelMultiplier` scaling. |

### Active Abilities (Phase 24.5)

Mutations can grant active combat abilities via the `active_ability` field:
- `command` — the combat command name (e.g., `"flashblind"`, `"toxicbite"`)
- `description` — player-facing help text
- `cooldown` — rounds before the ability can be used again
- `effect` — what happens when activated (damage, harmful condition, heal, etc.)

Active ability mutations: Blinding Flash, Toxic Bite, Sonic Shout, Healing Gel, Blinding Spit.
These share the special-move cooldown slot.

### Quad-Wielding (Phase 24.6)

The `extra-arms` mutation enables wielding weapons in 3rd and 4th hand slots.
Damage penalties apply (+20% for 3rd weapon, +40% for 4th). Disabled slots are
enforced when the mutation is absent.

### Acquisition System

Progress accumulates at `MutationProgressGain` (1.0) per combat round
while `character.Aggro != nil`. The Eye moon modulates rate (0.5x–1.5x).

Threshold formula (Phase 24.1 — load-based):
```
load = sum(rarity × level) for each owned mutation
threshold = MutationBaseProgress (50) × MutationProgressScale (1.5) ^ load
```

Higher rarity mutations contribute more to load, making subsequent acquisitions
progressively harder. This replaced the flat event-count formula.

When threshold is reached, `GetWeightedPool()` builds a slice where each
mutation appears `(11 - Rarity)` times.  Conflicting and already-owned mutations
are excluded. `RollAcquisition()` picks uniformly at random from that slice.

Maximum mutations per character: `MutationMaxCount` = 5.

### Body-Plan Gating (chunk 2.5)

`MutationSpec.RequiresBodyParts []string` lists canonical body-part tags
required for the mutation to apply. Empty/nil = body-agnostic. The legacy
`RequiresArms bool` field has been REMOVED — migration replaced it with
`RequiresBodyParts: [arms]`.

Three gating sites:

1. **Random-roll pool:** `GetWeightedPool(current, species)` filters
   out mutations whose body-parts requirements aren't met by the
   species. The signature changed from `GetWeightedPool(current,
   disabledSlots)` to take `*species.Species` directly.
2. **Curated SpawnMutations path:** `mobs.go` checks each entry via
   `MutationSpec.CanApplyTo(species)`; logs a warning + skips on
   mismatch.
3. **Mid-game grants:** Quest engine bridge + behavior tree
   `grant_mutation` action + player round tick all pass the user's
   species to `GetWeightedPool`. Pool-level filtering means body-
   part-incompatible mutations are silently excluded from candidates
   rather than producing an explicit rejection message (the spec's
   "Your body cannot integrate this mutation" line is reserved for
   a future direct-grant flow like mutation potions).

Boot-time validation (`ValidateBodyPartTags`) panics on unknown
body-part tags in any mutation YAML.

### Intrinsic Mutation Stacking

Species's `IntrinsicMutations` map merges additively with acquired
mutations at character init via `Character.ApplyIntrinsicMutations`.
Cap-aware: combined rank clamped to `MutationMaxRank = 4` (matches
the chunk-2.2a convention).

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/completed/2026-05-12-mob-aliveness-2.5-mutations-on-mobs-design.md`

### Conflict System (Phase 24.1)

Mutations can declare `conflicts: [id1, id2]` in their YAML. `HasConflict()`
checks both directions:
- Candidate's conflicts list vs owned mutations
- Each owned mutation's conflicts list vs candidate

Conflicting mutations are excluded from `GetWeightedPool()` during acquisition.

### Helper Functions

```go
// Gear effectiveness loss (chunk 2.2a — Incorporeal mutation)
GetGearEffectivenessLoss(owned map[string]int) float64   // Sum loss across owned
GearEffectivenessMultiplier(owned map[string]int) float64 // Convenience: (1.0 - loss)

// Physical defense bonus (chunk 2.2a — Incorporeal mutation)
GetPhysicalDefenseBonus(owned map[string]int) float64 // Sum bonus across owned

// Flag magnitude (graded lighting arc, plan 2: vision window)
FlagValue(owned map[string]int, flag string) float64 // Strongest RANK-SCALED Value across owned mutations granting flag, or 0

// Flag magnitude, every source (lighting plan 5c: infra reach combines)
FlagValues(owned map[string]int, flag string) []float64 // Each RANK-SCALED Value across owned mutations granting flag, zero values omitted
```

`FlagValue` is the MAX analogue of the summing helpers above: same
`for id, level := range owned`, `mult := LevelMultiplier(level)` loop shape,
but it keeps the strongest `p.Value * mult` rather than summing, so two
mutations granting the same flag (e.g. two night-sight sources) cannot stack
into a stronger shift than the better one grants, matching the MAX
aggregation `conditions.EffectKind.isMax()` uses on the condition side.
Comparison happens AFTER scaling, so a rank-1 mutation with a larger raw
`Value` can correctly lose to a rank-4 mutation with a smaller raw `Value`.
`GetMutationFlags` and `HasMutationFlag` only ever answered presence; the
rank-scaling in `FlagValue` is new, and the `Value` field it reads had been
declared on `MutationEffect` and silently ignored by every flag-effect
consumer until this plan.

`FlagValues` is the same loop with the same per-mutation `mult :=
LevelMultiplier(level)` scaling, but it appends every matching pro's or con's
scaled `Value` (nonzero only) instead of keeping just the largest. It exists
for a reader that combines sources some other way than MAX:
`internal/characters.Character.InfraReach` combines every entry it returns
(alongside every held condition's reach) through `lightscale.Combine` (a
sum of linear brightness since lighting plan 6)
(lighting plan 5c, owner ruling: infra reach sources combine, unlike
nightvision strength, which still reads `FlagValue`'s max).

Authored convention for a four-rank vision mutation: `value: 6`. At the
shipped rank multipliers (`MutationLevel2Multiplier` 1.6,
`MutationLevel3Multiplier` 2.5, `MutationLevel4Multiplier` 4.0, in
`_datafiles/config.yaml`), rank 4 scales to `6 * 4.0 = 24`, exactly
`windowShiftCap` in `internal/messaging/window.go`, the strongest window
the model allows, and nothing beyond it. 🔴 A bare test binary never loads
`_datafiles/config.yaml` and falls back to the Go default multipliers
(1.5 / 2.0 / 2.5 in `config.balance.progression.go`), so a rank-4 test
asserting this ceiling must pin the shipped multipliers explicitly with
`configs.SetConfigForTest` or it silently checks the wrong number.

### Registry

```go
mutations.LoadMutationFiles()   // called once from main.go at startup
mutations.GetMutation(id)       // look up a spec by id
mutations.GetAll()              // the full map
mutations.GetMutationLoad(m)    // rarity-weighted load for acquisition scaling
mutations.HasConflict(m, id)    // check if candidate conflicts with owned
```

## Character Fields

```go
// in internal/characters/character.go
Mutations        map[string]int  `yaml:"mutations,omitempty"`        // id → level
MutationProgress float64         `yaml:"mutationprogress,omitempty"` // combat pressure
```

`Validate()` ensures `Mutations` is never nil.

## Hook Integration Points

| Hook File | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_UserRoundTick.go` | Progress tick + acquisition trigger (load-based) |
| `internal/hooks/NewRound_DoCombat.go` | Adrenaline Surge bonus damage |
| `internal/hooks/spell_resolution.go` (`resolveMobSpellAgainstPlayer`) | Magical Resistance |
| `internal/usercommands/skill.cast.go` | Conviction cost multiplier |
| `internal/mobcommands/lookfortrouble.go` | Pheromone Glands aggro weight |

## The mutation set

**62 mutations ship** as of 2026-07-31. This document deliberately does **not**
enumerate them — the list went stale twice (it claimed 37 long after the
cluster expansion landed). The authoritative sources are:

- `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mutations/*.yaml` — one file per mutation. The boot
  log line `mutations.LoadMutationFiles() loadedCount=…` reports the live count.
- `graph.go` — the cluster graph: nine identity clusters (Colossus, Ironhide,
  Ravener, Stalker, Ethereal, Manifester, Zealot, Weaver, Trickster), each
  crowned by a single apex transformation.
- `opposition.go` — which mutations exclude which.

Broad shape: most are passive stat/flag modifiers; a minority grant an active
ability. Drift moves a character outward from generalist gifts toward the
cluster their play pattern matches.

---

## Adding a New Mutation

1. Create `_datafiles/world/dogmud/mutations/<mutationid>.yaml`
2. Fill in all fields (see `docs/schemas/mutation.md` for the full schema)
3. If using multi-effect, use `pros:` / `cons:` lists instead of singular `pro:` / `con:`
4. Add `conflicts:` if the mutation is incompatible with another
5. If the effect type is **new**, add a helper function in `mutations.go`
   and a hook call in the appropriate game system file
6. Restart the server

No Go code changes are required for existing effect types.

**Do not evaluate drift or pacing on an admin character.** A `role:` of admin
fires `SeedForCluster("admin")` during migration, which grants 11 keystones
outright and freezes drift (`internal/migration/grant.go`).
