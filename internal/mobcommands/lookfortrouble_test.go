// Stage 2 caravan: this is the mechanism that makes bandit lookouts engage
// the caravan crew when the caravan enters room 4052. Bandits with
// `hates: [caravan]` should aggro on caravan mobs that have
// `groups: [caravan]`.
//
// Design note: mob.Command() enqueues asynchronously (no event loop in
// tests). We verify the selection logic in two complementary sub-tests:
//
//  1. When Hates matches Groups, lookfortrouble queues a command (observed
//     via the event queue being non-empty OR by verifying that the attack
//     pipeline succeeds when driven with the expected target).
//  2. When Hates does NOT match Groups, lookfortrouble does NOT queue a
//     command (nothing in possibleMobTargets).
//
// Because util.GetTurnCount() returns 0 in tests (no game loop running),
// mob.lastCommandTurn stays 0 even after queueing — not a reliable signal.
// Instead we verify the selection outcome by confirming that Attack("#302")
// resolves correctly for this mob, paired with a contrast test showing that
// without the matching hate no attack is queued (boredom counter stays 0
// for mobs that despawn).
