# Time Module Context

## Purpose

`modules/time` is the player-facing `time` command: it renders the in-world
calendar — date, hour, day or night, and the moons — from `internal/gametime`.

The module is one file and one function. All the calendar logic lives in
`internal/gametime`; this is presentation only.

## API

```go
func TimeCommand(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error)
```

`timeLine(gd, period)` formats the reply for a period from
`gametime.DayPeriod` ("day", "night", "dusk", "dawn"); `TimeCommand` reads
`gametime.LampsLit()` for the current round only, since the testing
argument moves the date, not the sky.

## Gotchas

- **Do not put calendar arithmetic here.** Anything computing a period, a
  phase, or a transition belongs in `internal/gametime` where it can be reused
  and tested; this module should only format what that package returns.
- **Moon phases are floats in `[0, 1]`, not names.** Rendering them means
  bucketing (`CurrentMoonFlavorBucket`) — do not print the number.
- **Use `GetAllPhases()`** rather than three single-moon calls; each one
  recomputes all three.
